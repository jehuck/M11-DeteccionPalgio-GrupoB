       "'The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.  They\\nhad assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was\\nto take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon\\nhimself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention,\\nwithout restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.  Thus encouraged, the element but\\nlately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any\\nintervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such\\nillusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent\\ndisappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.\\nThe provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling\\nof his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b\\nchosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.  The proclamation convening this assemblage\\nalso announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were\\nsatisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and\\nprovided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to\\nbe disloyal.  As this action of Hamilton\\'s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty\\noath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious\\nopposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the\\ncolored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of\\nthe war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.  It\\nwas greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and\\nas it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless\\nthe freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon\\nreported from all parts of the State.\\n\\nHamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public\\nopinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.  As department\\ncommander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions\\nfor help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his\\nduties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.  By such\\ndisposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton,\\nand all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance\\nof an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the\\nduties of the office August 9, 1866.\\n\\nOne of Governor Throckmorton\\'s first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of\\nthe military.  This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson,\\non the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered\\ncontrol of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that\\nhad characterized the beginning of Hamilton\\'s administration.  Oppressive legislation in the\\nshape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross\\ninjustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and\\ndisorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till\\nCongress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation\\nof the seceded States.\\n\\nIn the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put\\nin operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.  This was effected under encouragement\\ngiven by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at\\nNew Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.  The constitution then agreed upon was submitted\\nto the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of\\nthe State.\\n\\nThe government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was\\nnever recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship\\nby the President\\'s amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.  The Legislature\\nwas in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President,\\non the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding\\ncivil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began\\nin Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led\\nto flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers\\nof outrages and murders.\\n\\nTo remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established\\nthe government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this\\nby reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening\\nunder certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.  Therefore, early in the\\nsummer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided\\nthat a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly\\nby B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.\\n\\nMayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action\\nas revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling\\nprevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.  A bloody\\nriot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.\\n\\nI happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called\\nby affairs on the Rio Grande.  On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on\\nthe night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details\\nof the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter,\\nGeneral Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government. But\\nour intelligence is not stopped by this. By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is\\nan \"absence of order.\"\\n\\nIn so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.\\n\\nIf it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder\\nmay indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then\\nthe implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which\\nwe shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade\\nby denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing\\nthe first.\\n\\nHow can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes? It is no use\\nfor us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak\\nof it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as\\nwe said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest\\nit, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of\\nthe empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies\\nsomething. But it is this analysis that we neglect to make. We omit it, precisely because\\nit does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.\\n\\nWe\\nsaid, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent. If there are two kinds of order, this\\ncontingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.\\nWhere I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have\\nbeen geometrical. But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of\\ndegrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to\\nme to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily\\nbelieve that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of\\nitself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which\\nthere is no order at all.\"\\n\\nAnd this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because\\nit is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is\\nan unquestionable fact.\\n\\n Div. of the Gulf, \"New Orleans, La.\\n\\n\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do\\nnot allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public\\nsafety.  Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the\\nfacts which occurred.\\n\\n\"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"\\n\\nIn obedience to the President\\'s directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another,\\nmore in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:\\n\\n\"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, \"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\\n\\n\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, \"President United States\\n\\n\"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.  A very large number\\nof colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed\\nfrom the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.  The speech of\\nDostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.  The speeches of the others, so far as I\\ncan learn, were characterized by moderation.  I have not given you the words of Dostie\\'s speech,\\nas the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they\\nwere intemperate.\\n\\n\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting\\nthemselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.  I think there were\\nabout twenty-six (26) members present.  In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting\\nwas held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18)\\nor twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty\\n(150).  Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of\\nevery tenth (10) man.\\n\\n\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored\\nmen marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American\\nflag. These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.  While\\ncrossing Canal Street a row occurred.  There were many spectators on the street, and their\\nmanner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.  A shot was fired, by whom I am not able\\nto state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.\\nThis led to other shots and a rush after the procession.  On arrival at the front of the Institute\\nthere was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.  The police, who had been held well in\\nhand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.  The procession entered the Institute\\nwith the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.  A row occurred between a policeman\\nand one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to\\nan indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.  This had been\\ngoing on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute,\\nwhereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\\n\\n\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen\\nopened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when\\nthey retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.  The door was broken in, and the firing\\nagain commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door\\nor were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the\\ncircle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens\\nthat formed the outer circle.  Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were\\nprisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.  The wounded were\\nstabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.  In the yard of the\\nbuilding, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they\\nwere fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.  Some were killed and wounded several squares\\nfrom the scene.  Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands\\nas prisoners, some of them mortally.\\n\\n\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote\\ncause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since\\nthe advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many\\ndesperate men, and some of them known murderers. People of clear views were overawed by want\\nof confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police\\nforce.  I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard\\nthem express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.  Ever since the intimation of this\\nlast convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting,\\nby their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.  As to the merciless manner in which the\\nconvention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\\n\\n\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward\\nNorthern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test\\nof what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant\\ndread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.\\nIf this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those\\nengaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in\\nother places.  No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens\\nwho were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.  The members\\nof the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held\\nto bail.  As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties\\non both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.  Judge Abell,\\nwhose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous\\nmen that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city. The leading men of the convention--King,\\nCutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.  I regret to say\\nthat the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he\\nhas shown very little of the man.\\n\\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN, \"Major-General Commanding.\"\\n\\nSubsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal\\nof testimony.  The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches,\\nand still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives,\\nof which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B.\\nM. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.  The majority report of the committee also corroborated,\\nin all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.  The committee likewise called\\nattention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging\\nthe origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted\\nand unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"  A list of\\nthe killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions\\nreached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who\\ncame together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....\\nThere has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute\\nof justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took\\nplace at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.\\n\\nThe statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that \\'rebels\\' and \\'thugs\\' and disloyal\\nmen had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police\\nforce.\"\\n\\nThe committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary\\nestablishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime\\nthe safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their\\nprotection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.\"\\n\\nThe New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served\\nto intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson\\'s policy of reconstruction,\\na policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was\\nmade plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States\\nunder conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to\\nsay, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated\\nslaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.\\n\\nSCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.\\n\\nLAFAYETTE S. FOSTER, President of the Senate pro tempore.\\n\\nSCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.\\n\\nB. F. WADE, President of the Senate pro tempore.\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nPASSAGE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ACT OVER THE PRESIDENT\\'S VETO--PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE FIFTH\\nMILITARY DISTRICT--REMOVING OFFICERS--MY REASONS FOR SUCH ACTION--AFFAIRS IN LOUISIANA AND\\nTEXAS--REMOVAL OF GOVERNOR WELLS--REVISION OF THE JURY LISTS--RELIEVED FROM THE COMMAND OF\\nTHE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\\n\\nThe first of the Reconstruction laws was passed March 2, 1867, and though vetoed by the President,\\nsuch was the unanimity of loyal sentiment and the urgency demanding the measure, that the bill\\nbecame a law over the veto the day the President returned it to Congress. March the 11th this\\nlaw was published in General Orders No. 10, from the Headquarters of the Army, the same order\\nassigning certain officers to take charge of the five military districts into which the States\\nlately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the commander of the Fifth Military\\nDistrict, which embraced Louisiana and Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion\\nof my command since the close of the war.\\n\\nBetween the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana Legislature, then in special\\nsession, had rejected a proposed repeal of an Act it had previously passed providing for an\\nelection of certain municipal officers in New Orleans.  This election was set for March 11,\\nbut the mayor and the chief of police, together with General Mower, commanding the troops in\\nthe city, having expressed to me personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed\\nby the election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the district, assuming the\\nauthority which the Act conferred on district commanders, declared that the election should\\nnot take place; that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter\\nwould stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions\\nbe had.  This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary\\nby the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications\\nof their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.\\n\\nA copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached\\nme a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19,\\nby an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional\\nonly, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled,\\nmodified, superseded, or abolished.  I also announced that no removals from office would be\\nmade unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization,\\nor unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization,\\nit is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various\\nbranches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and\\nits successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the\\npeople, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"\\n\\nUnder these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military\\ndistricts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.  In addition,\\nthese officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except\\nthose specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from\\nand appointment to office.\\n\\nIn the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had\\nbeen vetoed.  On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action,\\nit passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the\\neffect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question,\\nthe policy endorsed by the people of the country.  It was, therefore, my determination to see\\nto the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would\\nendeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced\\npersonal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the\\nmeasures enacted by Congress.\\n\\nHaving come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference\\nwith the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind\\nrulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them,\\nmy invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of\\nabsolute necessity.  The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout\\nthe district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.\\n\\nIn a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans,\\nfor it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission\\nand commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor,\\nJohn T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General\\nof the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus\\nvacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.  The officials thus removed had taken upon\\nthemselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise\\nsuch a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men\\nin sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.\\nThe President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and\\nI replied:\\n\\n\"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\\n\\n\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal\\nCourt of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John\\nT. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.  These removals were made under the powers granted\\nme in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of\\nthe United States.\\n\\n\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after\\nthe investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report\\nof the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for\\nthe cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:\\n\\n\"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans,\\nand for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating\\na large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no\\nprosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.  The records\\nof his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\\n\\n\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered\\nit his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.  This he failed to do, but went\\nso far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims\\nof the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty\\ninnocent.  He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on\\nthe massacre of July 30.\\n\\n\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general\\nwho would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent\\nguilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot\\nand massacre.\\n\\n\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population\\nof this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief\\nwill see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles\\nwhich might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.  Many of\\nthese persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their\\nwork so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could\\nreport them to General Grant.\\n\\nThe supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law\\ndespite the President\\'s veto on March 23. This was a curative act, authorizing elections and\\nprescribing methods of registration.  I also announced that until elections were held in accordance\\nwith these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of\\nthose persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases\\nexcepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.  There was one parish,\\nLivingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered\\nthere, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare\\nnull and void.\\n\\nIn April.  I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition\\nof eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing\\ndelegate to a Constitutional convention. It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled\\nand thereby filled the representation. The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes\\na void, removes a stopper. This inadequacy of act to representation\\nis precisely what we here call consciousness.  Before\\nannouncing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised\\nby the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending\\nan opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance\\nof the boards, I gave the following instructions:\\n\\n\"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT. \"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\\n\\n\"Special Orders, No. 15.\\n\\n\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank\\n(Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.  Election precincts will remain as\\nat present constituted.\\n\\n\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the\\noffice of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth\\nsection of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions\\nof the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each\\nperson registered.\\n\\n\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts,\\nhaving reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties\\non the day designated. And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted\\nby another tendency. How, then, could this occur in the domain of\\nlife, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies\\nis always implied?  Office-hours for registration\\nwill be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A. M., and from 4 till 7 P. M.\\n\\n\"When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district will designate the number\\nof polls and the places where they shall be opened in the election precincts within its district,\\nappoint the commissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting the elections,\\nand will superintend the same.\\n\\n\"They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the different precincts the\\nresult of the vote, consolidate the same, and forward it to the commanding general.\\n\\n\"Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to a rigid accountability\\nand will be subject to trial by military commission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct\\nin the performance of their duties.  Their rate of compensation and manner of payment will\\nbe in accordance with the provisions of sections six and seven of the supplemental act.\\n\\n\"Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on the question as to who\\nare disfranchised by law, registers will give the most rigid interpretation to the law, and\\nexclude from registration every person about whose right to vote there may be a doubt.  Any\\nperson so excluded who may, under the decision of the Attorney-General, be entitled to vote,\\nshall be permitted to register after that decision is received, due notice of which will be given.\\n\\n\"By command of Major-General P.

       "[\"The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.  They\\nhad assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was\\nto take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon\\nhimself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention,\\nwithout restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.  Thus encouraged, the element but\\nlately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any\\nintervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such\\nillusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent\\ndisappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.\\nThe provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling\\nof his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b\\nchosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.  The proclamation convening this assemblage\\nalso announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were\\nsatisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and\\nprovided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to\\nbe disloyal.  As this action of Hamilton's disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty\\noath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious\\nopposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the\\ncolored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of\\nthe war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.  It\\nwas greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and\\nas it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless\\nthe freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon\\nreported from all parts of the State.\",\n",

As department\\ncommander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions\\nfor help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his\\nduties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.  By such\\ndisposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton,\\nand all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance\\nof an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the\\nduties of the office August 9, 1866.',\n",

This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson,\\non the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered\\ncontrol of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that\\nhad characterized the beginning of Hamilton's administration.  Oppressive legislation in the\\nshape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross\\ninjustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and\\ndisorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till\\nCongress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation\\nof the seceded States.\",\n",

The constitution then agreed upon was submitted\\nto the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of\\nthe State.',\n",

Therefore, early in the\\nsummer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided\\nthat a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly\\nby B.

There were many spectators on the street, and their\\nmanner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.  A shot was fired, by whom I am not able\\nto state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.\\nThis led to other shots and a rush after the procession.  On arrival at the front of the Institute\\nthere was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.  The police, who had been held well in\\nhand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.  The procession entered the Institute\\nwith the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.  A row occurred between a policeman\\nand one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to\\nan indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.  This had been\\ngoing on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute,\\nwhereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.',\n",
       " '\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen\\nopened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when\\nthey retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.  The door was broken in, and the firing\\nagain commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door\\nor were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the\\ncircle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens\\nthat formed the outer circle.  Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were\\nprisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.  The wounded were\\nstabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.  In the yard of the\\nbuilding, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they\\nwere fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.  Some were killed and wounded several squares\\nfrom the scene.  Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands\\nas prisoners, some of them mortally.',\n",
       " '\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote\\ncause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since\\nthe advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many\\ndesperate men, and some of them known murderers. People of clear views were overawed by want\\nof confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police\\nforce.  I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard\\nthem express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.  Ever since the intimation of this\\nlast convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting,\\nby their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.  As to the merciless manner in which the\\nconvention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.',\n",
       " '\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward\\nNorthern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test\\nof what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant\\ndread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.\\nIf this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those\\nengaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in\\nother places.  No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens\\nwho were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.  The members\\nof the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held\\nto bail.  As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties\\non both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.  Judge Abell,\\nwhose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous\\nmen that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city. The leading men of the convention--King,\\nCutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.  I regret to say\\nthat the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he\\nhas shown very little of the man.',\n",

       " 'Subsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal\\nof testimony.  The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches,\\nand still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives,\\nof which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B.\\nM. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.  The majority report of the committee also corroborated,\\nin all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.  The committee likewise called\\nattention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging\\nthe origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted\\nand unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"  A list of\\nthe killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions\\nreached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who\\ncame together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....\\nThere has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute\\nof justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took\\nplace at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.',\n",

       " 'The first of the Reconstruction laws was passed March 2, 1867, and though vetoed by the President,\\nsuch was the unanimity of loyal sentiment and the urgency demanding the measure, that the bill\\nbecame a law over the veto the day the President returned it to Congress. March the 11th this\\nlaw was published in General Orders No. 10, from the Headquarters of the Army, the same order\\nassigning certain officers to take charge of the five military districts into which the States\\nlately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the commander of the Fifth Military\\nDistrict, which embraced Louisiana and Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion\\nof my command since the close of the war.',\n",
       " 'Between the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana Legislature, then in special\\nsession, had rejected a proposed repeal of an Act it had previously passed providing for an\\nelection of certain municipal officers in New Orleans.  This election was set for March 11,\\nbut the mayor and the chief of police, together with General Mower, commanding the troops in\\nthe city, having expressed to me personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed\\nby the election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the district, assuming the\\nauthority which the Act conferred on district commanders, declared that the election should\\nnot take place; that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter\\nwould stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions\\nbe had.  This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary\\nby the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications\\nof their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.',\n",
       " 'A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached\\nme a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19,\\nby an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional\\nonly, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled,\\nmodified, superseded, or abolished.  I also announced that no removals from office would be\\nmade unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization,\\nor unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization,\\nit is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various\\nbranches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and\\nits successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the\\npeople, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"',\n",
       " 'Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military\\ndistricts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.  In addition,\\nthese officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except\\nthose specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from\\nand appointment to office.',\n",
       " \"In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had\\nbeen vetoed.  On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President's adverse action,\\nit passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the\\neffect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question,\\nthe policy endorsed by the people of the country.  It was, therefore, my determination to see\\nto the law's zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would\\nendeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced\\npersonal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the\\nmeasures enacted by Congress.\",\n",
       " 'Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference\\nwith the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind\\nrulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them,\\nmy invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of\\nabsolute necessity.  The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout\\nthe district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.',\n",
       " 'In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans,\\nfor it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission\\nand commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor,\\nJohn T.

Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John\\nT. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.

       " '\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after\\nthe investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report\\nof the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for\\nthe cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:',\n",
       " '\"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans,\\nand for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating\\na large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no\\nprosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.  The records\\nof his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.',\n",
       " '\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered\\nit his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.  This he failed to do, but went\\nso far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims\\nof the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty\\ninnocent.  He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on\\nthe massacre of July 30.',\n",
       " '\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general\\nwho would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent\\nguilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot\\nand massacre.',\n",
       " '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population\\nof this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief\\nwill see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles\\nwhich might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.  Many of\\nthese persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their\\nwork so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could\\nreport them to General Grant.',\n",
       " \"The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law\\ndespite the President's veto on March 23. This was a curative act, authorizing elections and\\nprescribing methods of registration.  I also announced that until elections were held in accordance\\nwith these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of\\nthose persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases\\nexcepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.

This inadequacy of act to representation\\nis precisely what we here call consciousness.  Before\\nannouncing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised\\nby the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending\\nan opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance\\nof the boards, I gave the following instructions:',\n",

       "[\"The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.  They\\nhad assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was\\nto take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon\\nhimself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention,\\nwithout restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.  Thus encouraged, the element but\\nlately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any\\nintervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such\\nillusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent\\ndisappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.\\nThe provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling\\nof his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b\\nchosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.  The proclamation convening this assemblage\\nalso announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were\\nsatisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and\\nprovided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to\\nbe disloyal.  As this action of Hamilton's disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty\\noath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious\\nopposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the\\ncolored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of\\nthe war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.  It\\nwas greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and\\nas it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless\\nthe freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon\\nreported from all parts of the State.\",\n",
       " '\\n\\nHamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public\\nopinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.  As department\\ncommander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions\\nfor help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his\\nduties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.  By such\\ndisposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton,\\nand all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance\\nof an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the\\nduties of the office August 9, 1866.',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nOne of Governor Throckmorton's first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of\\nthe military.  This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson,\\non the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered\\ncontrol of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that\\nhad characterized the beginning of Hamilton's administration.  Oppressive legislation in the\\nshape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross\\ninjustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and\\ndisorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till\\nCongress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation\\nof the seceded States.\",\n",
       " \"\\n\\nIn the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put\\nin operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.  This was effected under encouragement\\ngiven by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at\\nNew Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.  The constitution then agreed upon was submitted\\nto the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of\\nthe State.\\n\\nThe government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was\\nnever recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship\\nby the President's amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.  The Legislature\\nwas in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President,\\non the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding\\ncivil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began\\nin Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led\\nto flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers\\nof outrages and murders.\",\n",
       " '\\n\\nTo remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established\\nthe government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this\\nby reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening\\nunder certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.  Therefore, early in the\\nsummer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided\\nthat a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly\\nby B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nMayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action\\nas revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling\\nprevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.  A bloody\\nriot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nI happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called\\nby affairs on the Rio Grande.  On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on\\nthe night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details\\nof the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter,\\nGeneral Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government. But\\nour intelligence is not stopped by this. By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is\\nan \"absence of order.\"',\n",
       " '\\n\\nIn so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.\\n\\nIf it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder\\nmay indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then\\nthe implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which\\nwe shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade\\nby denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing\\nthe first.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nHow can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes? It is no use\\nfor us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak\\nof it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as\\nwe said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest\\nit, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of\\nthe empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies\\nsomething. But it is this analysis that we neglect to make. We omit it, precisely because\\nit does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nWe\\nsaid, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent. If there are two kinds of order, this\\ncontingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.\\nWhere I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have\\nbeen geometrical. But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of\\ndegrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to\\nme to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily\\nbelieve that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of\\nitself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which\\nthere is no order at all.\"',\n",
       " '\\n\\nAnd this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because\\nit is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is\\nan unquestionable fact.',\n",

Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the\\nfacts which occurred.\\n\\n\"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"\\n\\nIn obedience to the President\\'s directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another,\\nmore in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:\\n\\n\"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, \"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\\n\\n\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, \"President United States',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.  A very large number\\nof colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed\\nfrom the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.  The speech of\\nDostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.  The speeches of the others, so far as I\\ncan learn, were characterized by moderation.  I have not given you the words of Dostie\\'s speech,\\nas the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they\\nwere intemperate.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting\\nthemselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.  I think there were\\nabout twenty-six (26) members present.  In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting\\nwas held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18)\\nor twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty\\n(150).  Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of\\nevery tenth (10) man.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored\\nmen marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American\\nflag. These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.  While\\ncrossing Canal Street a row occurred.  There were many spectators on the street, and their\\nmanner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.  A shot was fired, by whom I am not able\\nto state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.\\nThis led to other shots and a rush after the procession.  On arrival at the front of the Institute\\nthere was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.  The police, who had been held well in\\nhand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.  The procession entered the Institute\\nwith the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.  A row occurred between a policeman\\nand one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to\\nan indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.  This had been\\ngoing on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute,\\nwhereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen\\nopened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when\\nthey retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.  The door was broken in, and the firing\\nagain commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door\\nor were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the\\ncircle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens\\nthat formed the outer circle.  Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were\\nprisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.  The wounded were\\nstabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.  In the yard of the\\nbuilding, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they\\nwere fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.  Some were killed and wounded several squares\\nfrom the scene.  Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands\\nas prisoners, some of them mortally.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote\\ncause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since\\nthe advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many\\ndesperate men, and some of them known murderers. People of clear views were overawed by want\\nof confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police\\nforce.  I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard\\nthem express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.  Ever since the intimation of this\\nlast convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting,\\nby their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.  As to the merciless manner in which the\\nconvention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward\\nNorthern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test\\nof what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant\\ndread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.\\nIf this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those\\nengaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in\\nother places.  No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens\\nwho were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.  The members\\nof the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held\\nto bail.  As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties\\non both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.  Judge Abell,\\nwhose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous\\nmen that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city. The leading men of the convention--King,\\nCutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.  I regret to say\\nthat the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he\\nhas shown very little of the man.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN, \"Major-General Commanding.\"\\n\\nSubsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal\\nof testimony.  The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches,\\nand still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives,\\nof which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B.\\nM. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.  The majority report of the committee also corroborated,\\nin all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.  The committee likewise called\\nattention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging\\nthe origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted\\nand unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"  A list of\\nthe killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions\\nreached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who\\ncame together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....\\nThere has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute\\nof justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took\\nplace at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nThe statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that \\'rebels\\' and \\'thugs\\' and disloyal\\nmen had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police\\nforce.\"\\n\\nThe committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary\\nestablishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime\\nthe safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their\\nprotection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.\"',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nThe New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served\\nto intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson's policy of reconstruction,\\na policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was\\nmade plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States\\nunder conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to\\nsay, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated\\nslaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.\",\n",

       " '\\n\\nThe first of the Reconstruction laws was passed March 2, 1867, and though vetoed by the President,\\nsuch was the unanimity of loyal sentiment and the urgency demanding the measure, that the bill\\nbecame a law over the veto the day the President returned it to Congress. March the 11th this\\nlaw was published in General Orders No. 10, from the Headquarters of the Army, the same order\\nassigning certain officers to take charge of the five military districts into which the States\\nlately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the commander of the Fifth Military\\nDistrict, which embraced Louisiana and Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion\\nof my command since the close of the war.\\n\\nBetween the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana Legislature, then in special\\nsession, had rejected a proposed repeal of an Act it had previously passed providing for an\\nelection of certain municipal officers in New Orleans.  This election was set for March 11,\\nbut the mayor and the chief of police, together with General Mower, commanding the troops in\\nthe city, having expressed to me personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed\\nby the election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the district, assuming the\\nauthority which the Act conferred on district commanders, declared that the election should\\nnot take place; that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter\\nwould stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions\\nbe had.  This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary\\nby the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications\\nof their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nA copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached\\nme a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19,\\nby an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional\\nonly, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled,\\nmodified, superseded, or abolished.  I also announced that no removals from office would be\\nmade unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization,\\nor unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization,\\nit is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various\\nbranches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and\\nits successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the\\npeople, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"\\n\\nUnder these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military\\ndistricts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.  In addition,\\nthese officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except\\nthose specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from\\nand appointment to office.',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nIn the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had\\nbeen vetoed.  On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President's adverse action,\\nit passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the\\neffect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question,\\nthe policy endorsed by the people of the country.  It was, therefore, my determination to see\\nto the law's zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would\\nendeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced\\npersonal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the\\nmeasures enacted by Congress.\",\n",
       " '\\n\\nHaving come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference\\nwith the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind\\nrulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them,\\nmy invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of\\nabsolute necessity.  The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout\\nthe district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.',\n",
       " '\\n\\nIn a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans,\\nfor it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission\\nand commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor,\\nJohn T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General\\nof the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus\\nvacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.  The officials thus removed had taken upon\\nthemselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise\\nsuch a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men\\nin sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.\\nThe President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and\\nI replied:',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\\n\\n\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal\\nCourt of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John\\nT. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.  These removals were made under the powers granted\\nme in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of\\nthe United States.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after\\nthe investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report\\nof the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for\\nthe cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans,\\nand for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating\\na large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no\\nprosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.  The records\\nof his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered\\nit his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.  This he failed to do, but went\\nso far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims\\nof the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty\\ninnocent.  He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on\\nthe massacre of July 30.\\n\\n\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general\\nwho would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent\\nguilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot\\nand massacre.',\n",
       " '\\n\\n\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population\\nof this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief\\nwill see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles\\nwhich might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.  Many of\\nthese persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their\\nwork so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could\\nreport them to General Grant.',\n",
       " \"\\n\\nThe supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law\\ndespite the President's veto on March 23. This was a curative act, authorizing elections and\\nprescribing methods of registration.  I also announced that until elections were held in accordance\\nwith these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of\\nthose persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases\\nexcepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.  There was one parish,\\nLivingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered\\nthere, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare\\nnull and void.\",\n",
       " '\\n\\nIn April.  I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition\\nof eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing\\ndelegate to a Constitutional convention. It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled\\nand thereby filled the representation. The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes\\na void, removes a stopper. This inadequacy of act to representation\\nis precisely what we here call consciousness.  Before\\nannouncing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised\\nby the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending\\nan opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance\\nof the boards, I gave the following instructions:',\n",

       "['The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.They\\nhad assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was\\nto take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon\\nhimself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention,\\nwithout restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.Thus encouraged, the element but\\nlately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any\\nintervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such\\nillusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent\\ndisappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.The provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling\\nof his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b\\nchosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.The proclamation convening this assemblage\\nalso announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were\\nsatisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and\\nprovided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to\\nbe disloyal.As this action of Hamilton\\'s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty\\noath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious\\nopposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the\\ncolored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of\\nthe war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.It\\nwas greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and\\nas it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless\\nthe freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon\\nreported from all parts of the State.Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public\\nopinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.As department\\ncommander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions\\nfor help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his\\nduties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.By such\\ndisposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton,\\nand all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance\\nof an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the\\nduties of the office August 9, 1866.One of Governor Throckmorton\\'s first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of\\nthe military.This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson,\\non the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered\\ncontrol of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that\\nhad characterized the beginning of Hamilton\\'s administration.Oppressive legislation in the\\nshape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross\\ninjustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and\\ndisorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till\\nCongress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation\\nof the seceded States.In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put\\nin operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.This was effected under encouragement\\ngiven by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at\\nNew Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.The constitution then agreed upon was submitted\\nto the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of\\nthe State.The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was\\nnever recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship\\nby the President\\'s amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.The Legislature\\nwas in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President,\\non the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding\\ncivil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began\\nin Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led\\nto flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers\\nof outrages and murders.To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established\\nthe government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this\\nby reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening\\nunder certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.Therefore, early in the\\nsummer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided\\nthat a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly\\nby B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.Mayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action\\nas revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling\\nprevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.A bloody\\nriot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called\\nby affairs on the Rio Grande.On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on\\nthe night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details\\nof the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter,\\nGeneral Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government.But\\nour intelligence is not stopped by this.By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is\\nan \"absence of order.\"In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder\\nmay indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then\\nthe implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which\\nwe shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade\\nby denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing\\nthe first.How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes?It is no use\\nfor us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak\\nof it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as\\nwe said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest\\nit, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of\\nthe empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies\\nsomething.But it is this analysis that we neglect to make.We omit it, precisely because\\nit does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.We\\nsaid, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent.If there are two kinds of order, this\\ncontingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have\\nbeen geometrical.But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of\\ndegrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to\\nme to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily\\nbelieve that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of\\nitself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which\\nthere is no order at all.\"And this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because\\nit is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is\\nan unquestionable fact.',\n",

       " 'I think there were\\nabout twenty-six (26) members present.In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting\\nwas held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18)\\nor twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty\\n(150).Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of\\nevery tenth (10) man.\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored\\nmen marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American\\nflag.These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.While\\ncrossing Canal Street a row occurred.There were many spectators on the street, and their\\nmanner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.A shot was fired, by whom I am not able\\nto state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.This led to other shots and a rush after the procession.On arrival at the front of the Institute\\nthere was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.The police, who had been held well in\\nhand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.The procession entered the Institute\\nwith the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.A row occurred between a policeman\\nand one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to\\nan indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.This had been\\ngoing on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute,\\nwhereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen\\nopened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when\\nthey retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.',\n",
       " 'The door was broken in, and the firing\\nagain commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door\\nor were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the\\ncircle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens\\nthat formed the outer circle.Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were\\nprisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.The wounded were\\nstabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.In the yard of the\\nbuilding, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they\\nwere fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.Some were killed and wounded several squares\\nfrom the scene.Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands\\nas prisoners, some of them mortally.\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote\\ncause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since\\nthe advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many\\ndesperate men, and some of them known murderers.People of clear views were overawed by want\\nof confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police\\nforce.I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard\\nthem express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.Ever since the intimation of this\\nlast convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting,\\nby their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.As to the merciless manner in which the\\nconvention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward\\nNorthern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test\\nof what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant\\ndread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.',\n",

       " 'In addition,\\nthese officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except\\nthose specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from\\nand appointment to office.In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had\\nbeen vetoed.On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action,\\nit passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the\\neffect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question,\\nthe policy endorsed by the people of the country.It was, therefore, my determination to see\\nto the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would\\nendeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced\\npersonal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the\\nmeasures enacted by Congress.Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference\\nwith the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind\\nrulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them,\\nmy invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of\\nabsolute necessity.The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout\\nthe district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans,\\nfor it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission\\nand commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor,\\nJohn T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General\\nof the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus\\nvacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.The officials thus removed had taken upon\\nthemselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise\\nsuch a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men\\nin sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.The President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and\\nI replied:\\n\\n\"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal\\nCourt of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John\\nT. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.These removals were made under the powers granted\\nme in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of\\nthe United States.\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after\\nthe investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report\\nof the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for\\nthe cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:\\n\\n\"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans,\\nand for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating\\na large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no\\nprosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.',\n",
       " 'The records\\nof his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered\\nit his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.This he failed to do, but went\\nso far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims\\nof the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty\\ninnocent.He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on\\nthe massacre of July 30.\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general\\nwho would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent\\nguilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot\\nand massacre.',\n",
       " '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population\\nof this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief\\nwill see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles\\nwhich might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.Many of\\nthese persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their\\nwork so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could\\nreport them to General Grant.The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law\\ndespite the President\\'s veto on March 23.This was a curative act, authorizing elections and\\nprescribing methods of registration.I also announced that until elections were held in accordance\\nwith these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of\\nthose persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases\\nexcepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.There was one parish,\\nLivingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered\\nthere, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare\\nnull and void.In April.I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition\\nof eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing\\ndelegate to a Constitutional convention.It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled\\nand thereby filled the representation.The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes\\na void, removes a stopper.This inadequacy of act to representation\\nis precisely what we here call consciousness.Before\\nannouncing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised\\nby the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending\\nan opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance\\nof the boards, I gave the following instructions:\\n\\n\"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\"Special Orders, No.',\n",
       " '15.\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank\\n(Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.Election precincts will remain as\\nat present constituted.\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the\\noffice of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth\\nsection of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions\\nof the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each\\nperson registered.',\n",
       " '\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts,\\nhaving reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties\\non the day designated.And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted\\nby another tendency.How, then, could this occur in the domain of\\nlife, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies\\nis always implied?Office-hours for registration\\nwill be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A. M., and from 4 till 7 P. M.\\n\\n\"When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district will designate the number\\nof polls and the places where they shall be opened in the election precincts within its district,\\nappoint the commissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting the elections,\\nand will superintend the same.\"They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the different precincts the\\nresult of the vote, consolidate the same, and forward it to the commanding general.\"Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to a rigid accountability\\nand will be subject to trial by military commission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct\\nin the performance of their duties.',\n",
       " 'Their rate of compensation and manner of payment will\\nbe in accordance with the provisions of sections six and seven of the supplemental act.\"Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on the question as to who\\nare disfranchised by law, registers will give the most rigid interpretation to the law, and\\nexclude from registration every person about whose right to vote there may be a doubt.Any\\nperson so excluded who may, under the decision of the Attorney-General, be entitled to vote,\\nshall be permitted to register after that decision is received, due notice of which will be given.\"By command of Major-General P.

      "['The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.They had assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was to take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon himself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention, without restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.Thus encouraged, the element but lately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any intervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such illusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent disappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.The provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling of his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b chosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.The proclamation convening this assemblage also announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were satisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and provided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to be disloyal.As this action of Hamilton\\'s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty oath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious opposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the colored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of the war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.It was greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and as it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless the freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon reported from all parts of the State.Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public opinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.As department commander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions for help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his duties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.By such disposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton, and all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance of an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the duties of the office August 9, 1866.One of Governor Throckmorton\\'s first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of the military.This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson, on the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered control of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that had characterized the beginning of Hamilton\\'s administration.Oppressive legislation in the shape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross injustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and disorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till Congress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation of the seceded States.In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put in operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.This was effected under encouragement given by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at New Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.The constitution then agreed upon was submitted to the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of the State.The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was never recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship by the President\\'s amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.The Legislature was in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President, on the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding civil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began in Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led to flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers of outrages and murders.To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established the government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this by reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening under certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.Therefore, early in the summer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided that a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly by B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.Mayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action as revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling prevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.A bloody riot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called by affairs on the Rio Grande.On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter, General Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government.But our intelligence is not stopped by this.By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is an \"absence of order.\"In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder may indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then the implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which we shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade by denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing the first.How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes?It is no use for us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak of it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as we said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest it, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of the empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies something.But it is this analysis that we neglect to make.We omit it, precisely because it does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.We said, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent.If there are two kinds of order, this contingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have been geometrical.But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of degrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to me to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily believe that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of itself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which there is no order at all.\"And this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because it is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is an unquestionable fact.', 'Div.of the Gulf, \"New Orleans, La.\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do not allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety.Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the facts which occurred.\"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"', 'In obedience to the President\\'s directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another, more in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:  \"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, \"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, \"President United States  \"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.A very large number of colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed from the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.The speech of Dostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.The speeches of the others, so far as I can learn, were characterized by moderation.I have not given you the words of Dostie\\'s speech, as the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they were intemperate.\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting themselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.', 'I think there were about twenty-six (26) members present.In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18) or twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty (150).Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of every tenth (10) man.\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored men marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American flag.These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.While crossing Canal Street a row occurred.There were many spectators on the street, and their manner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.This led to other shots and a rush after the procession.On arrival at the front of the Institute there was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.The police, who had been held well in hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.The procession entered the Institute with the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.A row occurred between a policeman and one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to an indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.This had been going on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute, whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen opened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.', 'The door was broken in, and the firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door or were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the circle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens that formed the outer circle.Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.The wounded were stabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.In the yard of the building, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they were fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.Some were killed and wounded several squares from the scene.Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands as prisoners, some of them mortally.\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote cause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since the advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many desperate men, and some of them known murderers.People of clear views were overawed by want of confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police force.I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard them express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.Ever since the intimation of this last convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting, by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test of what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.', 'If this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in other places.No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens who were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.The members of the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.Judge Abell, whose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city.The leading men of the convention--King, Cutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.I regret to say that the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he has shown very little of the man.\"P. H. SHERIDAN, \"Major-General Commanding.\"Subsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal of testimony.', 'The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches, and still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives, of which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B. M. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.The majority report of the committee also corroborated, in all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.The committee likewise called attention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging the origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted and unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"A list of the killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions reached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who came together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....There has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute of justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took place at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.The statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that \\'rebels\\' and \\'thugs\\' and disloyal men had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police force.\"The committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary establishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime the safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their protection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.\"', 'The New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served to intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson\\'s policy of reconstruction, a policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was made plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States under conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to say, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated slaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.SCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.LAFAYETTE S.

that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter would stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions be had.This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary by the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications of their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached me a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19, by an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional only, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled, modified, superseded, or abolished.I also announced that no removals from office would be made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization, or unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization, it is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various branches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and its successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the people, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military districts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.', 'In addition, these officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except those specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from and appointment to office.In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had been vetoed.On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action, it passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question, the policy endorsed by the people of the country.It was, therefore, my determination to see to the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would endeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced personal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the measures enacted by Congress.Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference with the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them, my invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of absolute necessity.The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout the district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans, for it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission and commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor, John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General of the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus vacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.The officials thus removed had taken upon themselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise such a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.The President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and I replied:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.These removals were made under the powers granted me in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after the investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:  \"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.', 'The records of his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the massacre of July 30.\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot and massacre.', '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.Many of these persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law despite the President\\'s veto on March 23.This was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing methods of registration.I also announced that until elections were held in accordance with these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.There was one parish, Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered there, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.In April.I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing delegate to a Constitutional convention.It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled and thereby filled the representation.The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes a void, removes a stopper.This inadequacy of act to representation is precisely what we here call consciousness.Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the following instructions:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\"Special Orders, No.', '15.\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.Election precincts will remain as at present constituted.\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each person registered.', '\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts, having reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day designated.And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted by another tendency.How, then, could this occur in the domain of life, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies is always implied?Office-hours for registration will be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A.

      "['The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.They had assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was to take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon himself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention, without restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.Thus encouraged, the element but lately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any intervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such illusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent disappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.The provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling of his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b chosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.The proclamation convening this assemblage also announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were satisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and provided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to be disloyal.As this action of Hamilton\\'s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty oath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious opposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the colored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of the war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.It was greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and as it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless the freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon reported from all parts of the State.Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public opinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.As department commander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions for help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his duties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.By such disposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton, and all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance of an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the duties of the office August 9, 1866.One of Governor Throckmorton\\'s first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of the military.This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson, on the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered control of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that had characterized the beginning of Hamilton\\'s administration.Oppressive legislation in the shape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross injustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and disorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till Congress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation of the seceded States.In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put in operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.This was effected under encouragement given by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at New Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.The constitution then agreed upon was submitted to the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of the State.The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was never recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship by the President\\'s amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.The Legislature was in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President, on the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding civil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began in Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led to flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers of outrages and murders.To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established the government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this by reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening under certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.Therefore, early in the summer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided that a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly by B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.Mayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action as revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling prevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.A bloody riot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called by affairs on the Rio Grande.On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter, General Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government.But our intelligence is not stopped by this.By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is an \"absence of order.\"In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder may indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then the implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which we shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade by denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing the first.How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes?It is no use for us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak of it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as we said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest it, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of the empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies something.But it is this analysis that we neglect to make.We omit it, precisely because it does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.We said, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent.If there are two kinds of order, this contingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have been geometrical.But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of degrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to me to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily believe that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of itself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which there is no order at all.\"And this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because it is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is an unquestionable fact.', 'Div.of the Gulf, \"New Orleans, La.\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do not allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety.Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the facts which occurred.\"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"', 'In obedience to the President\\'s directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another, more in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:  \"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, \"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, \"President United States  \"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.A very large number of colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed from the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.The speech of Dostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.The speeches of the others, so far as I can learn, were characterized by moderation.I have not given you the words of Dostie\\'s speech, as the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they were intemperate.\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting themselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.', 'I think there were about twenty-six (26) members present.In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18) or twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty (150).Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of every tenth (10) man.\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored men marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American flag.These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.While crossing Canal Street a row occurred.There were many spectators on the street, and their manner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.This led to other shots and a rush after the procession.On arrival at the front of the Institute there was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.The police, who had been held well in hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.The procession entered the Institute with the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.A row occurred between a policeman and one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to an indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.This had been going on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute, whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen opened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.', 'The door was broken in, and the firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door or were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the circle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens that formed the outer circle.Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.The wounded were stabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.In the yard of the building, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they were fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.Some were killed and wounded several squares from the scene.Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands as prisoners, some of them mortally.\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote cause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since the advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many desperate men, and some of them known murderers.People of clear views were overawed by want of confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police force.I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard them express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.Ever since the intimation of this last convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting, by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test of what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.', 'If this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in other places.No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens who were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.The members of the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.Judge Abell, whose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city.The leading men of the convention--King, Cutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.I regret to say that the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he has shown very little of the man.\"P. H. SHERIDAN, \"Major-General Commanding.\"Subsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal of testimony.', 'The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches, and still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives, of which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B. M. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.The majority report of the committee also corroborated, in all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.The committee likewise called attention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging the origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted and unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"A list of the killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions reached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who came together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....There has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute of justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took place at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.The statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that \\'rebels\\' and \\'thugs\\' and disloyal men had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police force.\"The committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary establishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime the safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their protection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.\"', 'The New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served to intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson\\'s policy of reconstruction, a policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was made plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States under conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to say, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated slaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.SCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.LAFAYETTE S.

WADE, President of the Senate pro tempore.CHAPTER XI.PASSAGE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ACT OVER THE PRESIDENT\\'S VETO--PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT--REMOVING OFFICERS--MY REASONS FOR SUCH ACTION--AFFAIRS IN LOUISIANA AND TEXAS--REMOVAL OF GOVERNOR WELLS--REVISION OF THE JURY LISTS--RELIEVED FROM THE COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.The first of the Reconstruction laws was passed March 2, 1867, and though vetoed by the President, such was the unanimity of loyal sentiment and the urgency demanding the measure, that the bill became a law over the veto the day the President returned it to Congress.March the 11th this law was published in General Orders No.10, from the Headquarters of the Army, the same order assigning certain officers to take charge of the five military districts into which the States lately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the commander of the Fifth Military District, which embraced Louisiana and Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion of my command since the close of the war.Between the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana Legislature, then in special session, had rejected a proposed repeal of an Act it had previously passed providing for an election of certain municipal officers in New Orleans.This election was set for March 11, but the mayor and the chief of police, together with General Mower, commanding the troops in the city, having expressed to me personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed by the election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the district, assuming the authority which the Act conferred on district commanders, declared that the election should not take place; that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter would stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions be had.This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary by the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications of their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached me a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19, by an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional only, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled, modified, superseded, or abolished.I also announced that no removals from office would be made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization, or unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization, it is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various branches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and its successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the people, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military districts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.', 'In addition, these officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except those specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from and appointment to office.In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had been vetoed.On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action, it passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question, the policy endorsed by the people of the country.It was, therefore, my determination to see to the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would endeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced personal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the measures enacted by Congress.Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference with the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them, my invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of absolute necessity.The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout the district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans, for it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission and commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor, John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General of the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus vacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.The officials thus removed had taken upon themselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise such a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.The President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and I replied:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.These removals were made under the powers granted me in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after the investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:  \"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.', 'The records of his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the massacre of July 30.\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot and massacre.', '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.Many of these persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law despite the President\\'s veto on March 23.This was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing methods of registration.I also announced that until elections were held in accordance with these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.There was one parish, Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered there, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.In April.I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing delegate to a Constitutional convention.It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled and thereby filled the representation.The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes a void, removes a stopper.This inadequacy of act to representation is precisely what we here call consciousness.Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the following instructions:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\"Special Orders, No.', '15.\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.Election precincts will remain as at present constituted.\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each person registered.', '\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts, having reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day designated.And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted by another tendency.How, then, could this occur in the domain of life, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies is always implied?Office-hours for registration will be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A.

      "['The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.They had assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was to take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon himself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention, without restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.Thus encouraged, the element but lately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any intervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such illusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent disappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.The provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling of his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b chosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.The proclamation convening this assemblage also announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were satisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and provided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to be disloyal.As this action of Hamilton\\'s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty oath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious opposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the colored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of the war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.It was greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and as it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless the freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon reported from all parts of the State.Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public opinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.As department commander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions for help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his duties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.By such disposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton, and all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance of an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the duties of the office August 9, 1866.One of Governor Throckmorton\\'s first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of the military.This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson, on the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered control of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that had characterized the beginning of Hamilton\\'s administration.Oppressive legislation in the shape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross injustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and disorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till Congress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation of the seceded States.In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put in operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.This was effected under encouragement given by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at New Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.The constitution then agreed upon was submitted to the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of the State.The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was never recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship by the President\\'s amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.The Legislature was in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President, on the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding civil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began in Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led to flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers of outrages and murders.To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established the government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this by reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening under certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.Therefore, early in the summer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided that a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly by B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.Mayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action as revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling prevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.A bloody riot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called by affairs on the Rio Grande.On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter, General Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government.But our intelligence is not stopped by this.By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is an \"absence of order.\"In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder may indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then the implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which we shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade by denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing the first.How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes?It is no use for us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak of it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as we said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest it, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of the empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies something.But it is this analysis that we neglect to make.We omit it, precisely because it does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.We said, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent.If there are two kinds of order, this contingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have been geometrical.But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of degrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to me to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily believe that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of itself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which there is no order at all.\"And this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because it is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is an unquestionable fact.', 'Div.of the Gulf, \"New Orleans, La.\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do not allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety.Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the facts which occurred.\"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"', 'In obedience to the President\\'s directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another, more in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:  \"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, \"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, \"President United States  \"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.A very large number of colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed from the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.The speech of Dostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.The speeches of the others, so far as I can learn, were characterized by moderation.I have not given you the words of Dostie\\'s speech, as the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they were intemperate.\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting themselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.', 'I think there were about twenty-six (26) members present.In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18) or twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty (150).Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of every tenth (10) man.\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored men marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American flag.These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.While crossing Canal Street a row occurred.There were many spectators on the street, and their manner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.This led to other shots and a rush after the procession.On arrival at the front of the Institute there was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.The police, who had been held well in hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.The procession entered the Institute with the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.A row occurred between a policeman and one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to an indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.This had been going on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute, whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen opened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.', 'The door was broken in, and the firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door or were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the circle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens that formed the outer circle.Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.The wounded were stabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.In the yard of the building, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they were fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.Some were killed and wounded several squares from the scene.Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands as prisoners, some of them mortally.\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote cause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since the advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many desperate men, and some of them known murderers.People of clear views were overawed by want of confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police force.I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard them express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.Ever since the intimation of this last convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting, by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test of what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.', 'If this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in other places.No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens who were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.The members of the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.Judge Abell, whose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city.The leading men of the convention--King, Cutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.I regret to say that the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he has shown very little of the man.\"P. H. SHERIDAN, \"Major-General Commanding.\"Subsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal of testimony.', 'The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches, and still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives, of which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B. M. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.The majority report of the committee also corroborated, in all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.The committee likewise called attention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging the origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted and unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"A list of the killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions reached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who came together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....There has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute of justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took place at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.The statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that \\'rebels\\' and \\'thugs\\' and disloyal men had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police force.\"The committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary establishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime the safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their protection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.\"', 'The New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served to intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson\\'s policy of reconstruction, a policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was made plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States under conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to say, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated slaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.SCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.LAFAYETTE S.

WADE, President of the Senate pro tempore.CHAPTER XI.PASSAGE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ACT OVER THE PRESIDENT\\'S VETO--PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT--REMOVING OFFICERS--MY REASONS FOR SUCH ACTION--AFFAIRS IN LOUISIANA AND TEXAS--REMOVAL OF GOVERNOR WELLS--REVISION OF THE JURY LISTS--RELIEVED FROM THE COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.The first of the Reconstruction laws was passed March 2, 1867, and though vetoed by the President, such was the unanimity of loyal sentiment and the urgency demanding the measure, that the bill became a law over the veto the day the President returned it to Congress.March the 11th this law was published in General Orders No.10, from the Headquarters of the Army, the same order assigning certain officers to take charge of the five military districts into which the States lately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the commander of the Fifth Military District, which embraced Louisiana and Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion of my command since the close of the war.Between the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana Legislature, then in special session, had rejected a proposed repeal of an Act it had previously passed providing for an election of certain municipal officers in New Orleans.This election was set for March 11, but the mayor and the chief of police, together with General Mower, commanding the troops in the city, having expressed to me personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed by the election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the district, assuming the authority which the Act conferred on district commanders, declared that the election should not take place; that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter would stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions be had.This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary by the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications of their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached me a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19, by an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional only, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled, modified, superseded, or abolished.I also announced that no removals from office would be made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization, or unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization, it is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various branches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and its successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the people, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military districts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.', 'In addition, these officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except those specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from and appointment to office.In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had been vetoed.On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action, it passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question, the policy endorsed by the people of the country.It was, therefore, my determination to see to the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would endeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced personal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the measures enacted by Congress.Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference with the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them, my invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of absolute necessity.The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout the district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans, for it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission and commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor, John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General of the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus vacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.The officials thus removed had taken upon themselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise such a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.The President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and I replied:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.These removals were made under the powers granted me in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after the investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:  \"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.', 'The records of his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the massacre of July 30.\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot and massacre.', '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.Many of these persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law despite the President\\'s veto on March 23.This was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing methods of registration.I also announced that until elections were held in accordance with these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.There was one parish, Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered there, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.In April.I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing delegate to a Constitutional convention.It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled and thereby filled the representation.The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes a void, removes a stopper.This inadequacy of act to representation is precisely what we here call consciousness.Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the following instructions:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\"Special Orders, No.', '15.\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.Election precincts will remain as at present constituted.\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each person registered.', '\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts, having reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day designated.And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted by another tendency.How, then, could this occur in the domain of life, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies is always implied?Office-hours for registration will be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A. M., and from 4 till 7 P. M.  \"When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district will designate the number of polls and the places where they shall be opened in the election precincts within its district, appoint the commissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting the elections, and will superintend the same.\"They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the different precincts the result of the vote, consolidate the same, and forward it to the commanding general.\"Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to a rigid accountability and will be subject to trial by military commission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct in the performance of their duties.', 'Their rate of compensation and manner of payment will be in accordance with the provisions of sections six and seven of the supplemental act.\"Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on the question as to who are disfranchised by law, registers will give the most rigid interpretation to the law, and exclude from registration every person about whose right to vote there may be a doubt.Any person so excluded who may, under the decision of the Attorney-General, be entitled to vote, shall be permitted to register after that decision is received, due notice of which will be given.\"By command of Major-General P.

Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action as revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling prevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.A bloody riot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called by affairs on the Rio Grande.On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter, General Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government.But our intelligence is not stopped by this.By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is an \"absence of order.\"In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder may indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then the implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which we shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade by denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing the first.How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes?It is no use for us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak of it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as we said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest it, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of the empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies something.But it is this analysis that we neglect to make.We omit it, precisely because it does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.We said, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent.If there are two kinds of order, this contingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have been geometrical.But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of degrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to me to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily believe that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of itself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which there is no order at all.\"And this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because it is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is an unquestionable fact.', 'Div.of the Gulf, \"New Orleans, La.\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do not allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety.Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the facts which occurred.\"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"', 'In obedience to the President\\'s directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another, more in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:  \"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, \"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, \"President United States  \"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.A very large number of colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed from the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.The speech of Dostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.The speeches of the others, so far as I can learn, were characterized by moderation.I have not given you the words of Dostie\\'s speech, as the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they were intemperate.\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting themselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.', 'I think there were about twenty-six (26) members present.In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18) or twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty (150).Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of every tenth (10) man.\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored men marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American flag.These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.While crossing Canal Street a row occurred.There were many spectators on the street, and their manner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.This led to other shots and a rush after the procession.On arrival at the front of the Institute there was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.The police, who had been held well in hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.The procession entered the Institute with the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.A row occurred between a policeman and one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to an indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.This had been going on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute, whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen opened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.', 'The door was broken in, and the firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door or were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the circle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens that formed the outer circle.Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.The wounded were stabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.In the yard of the building, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they were fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.Some were killed and wounded several squares from the scene.Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands as prisoners, some of them mortally.\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote cause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since the advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many desperate men, and some of them known murderers.People of clear views were overawed by want of confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police force.I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard them express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.Ever since the intimation of this last convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting, by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test of what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.', 'If this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in other places.No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens who were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.The members of the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.Judge Abell, whose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city.The leading men of the convention--King, Cutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.I regret to say that the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he has shown very little of the man.\"P. H. SHERIDAN, \"Major-General Commanding.\"Subsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal of testimony.', 'The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches, and still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives, of which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B. M. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.The majority report of the committee also corroborated, in all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.The committee likewise called attention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging the origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted and unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"A list of the killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions reached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who came together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....There has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute of justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took place at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.The statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that \\'rebels\\' and \\'thugs\\' and disloyal men had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police force.\"The committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary establishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime the safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their protection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.\"', 'The New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served to intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson\\'s policy of reconstruction, a policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was made plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States under conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to say, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated slaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.SCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.LAFAYETTE S.

that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter would stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions be had.This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary by the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications of their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached me a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19, by an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional only, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled, modified, superseded, or abolished.I also announced that no removals from office would be made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization, or unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization, it is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various branches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and its successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the people, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military districts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.', 'In addition, these officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except those specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from and appointment to office.In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had been vetoed.On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action, it passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question, the policy endorsed by the people of the country.It was, therefore, my determination to see to the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would endeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced personal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the measures enacted by Congress.Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference with the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them, my invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of absolute necessity.The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout the district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans, for it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission and commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor, John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General of the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus vacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.The officials thus removed had taken upon themselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise such a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.The President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and I replied:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.These removals were made under the powers granted me in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after the investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:  \"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.', 'The records of his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the massacre of July 30.\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot and massacre.', '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.Many of these persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law despite the President\\'s veto on March 23.This was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing methods of registration.I also announced that until elections were held in accordance with these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.There was one parish, Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered there, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.In April.I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing delegate to a Constitutional convention.It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled and thereby filled the representation.The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes a void, removes a stopper.This inadequacy of act to representation is precisely what we here call consciousness.Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the following instructions:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\"Special Orders, No.', '15.\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.Election precincts will remain as at present constituted.\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each person registered.', '\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts, having reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day designated.And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted by another tendency.How, then, could this occur in the domain of life, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies is always implied?Office-hours for registration will be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A. M., and from 4 till 7 P. M.  \"When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district will designate the number of polls and the places where they shall be opened in the election precincts within its district, appoint the commissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting the elections, and will superintend the same.\"They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the different precincts the result of the vote, consolidate the same, and forward it to the commanding general.\"Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to a rigid accountability and will be subject to trial by military commission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct in the performance of their duties.', 'Their rate of compensation and manner of payment will be in accordance with the provisions of sections six and seven of the supplemental act.\"Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on the question as to who are disfranchised by law, registers will give the most rigid interpretation to the law, and exclude from registration every person about whose right to vote there may be a doubt.Any person so excluded who may, under the decision of the Attorney-General, be entitled to vote, shall be permitted to register after that decision is received, due notice of which will be given.\"By command of Major-General P. H.']\n",

      "['The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.They had assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was to take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon himself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention, without restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.Thus encouraged, the element but lately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any intervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such illusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent disappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.The provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling of his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b chosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.The proclamation convening this assemblage also announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were satisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and provided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to be disloyal.As this action of Hamilton\\'s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty oath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious opposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the colored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of the war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.It was greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and as it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless the freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon reported from all parts of the State.Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public opinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.As department commander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions for help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his duties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.By such disposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton, and all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance of an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the duties of the office August 9, 1866.One of Governor Throckmorton\\'s first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of the military.This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson, on the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered control of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that had characterized the beginning of Hamilton\\'s administration.Oppressive legislation in the shape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross injustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and disorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till Congress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation of the seceded States.In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put in operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.This was effected under encouragement given by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at New Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.The constitution then agreed upon was submitted to the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of the State.The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was never recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship by the President\\'s amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.The Legislature was in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President, on the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding civil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began in Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led to flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers of outrages and murders.To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established the government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this by reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening under certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.Therefore, early in the summer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided that a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly by B.

but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they were intemperate.\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting themselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.', 'I think there were about twenty-six (26) members present.In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18) or twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty (150).Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of every tenth (10) man.\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored men marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American flag.These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.While crossing Canal Street a row occurred.There were many spectators on the street, and their manner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.This led to other shots and a rush after the procession.On arrival at the front of the Institute there was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.The police, who had been held well in hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.The procession entered the Institute with the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.A row occurred between a policeman and one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to an indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.This had been going on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute, whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen opened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.', 'The door was broken in, and the firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door or were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the circle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens that formed the outer circle.Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.The wounded were stabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.In the yard of the building, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they were fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.Some were killed and wounded several squares from the scene.Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands as prisoners, some of them mortally.\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote cause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since the advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many desperate men, and some of them known murderers.People of clear views were overawed by want of confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police force.I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard them express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.Ever since the intimation of this last convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting, by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test of what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.', 'If this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in other places.No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens who were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.The members of the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.Judge Abell, whose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city.The leading men of the convention--King, Cutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.I regret to say that the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he has shown very little of the man.\"P. H.

L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B. M. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.The majority report of the committee also corroborated, in all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.The committee likewise called attention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging the origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted and unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"A list of the killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions reached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who came together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....There has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute of justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took place at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.The statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that \\'rebels\\' and \\'thugs\\' and disloyal men had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police force.\"The committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary establishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime the safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their protection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.\"', 'The New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served to intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson\\'s policy of reconstruction, a policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was made plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States under conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to say, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated slaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.SCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.LAFAYETTE S.

that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter would stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions be had.This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary by the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications of their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached me a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19, by an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional only, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled, modified, superseded, or abolished.I also announced that no removals from office would be made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization, or unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization, it is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various branches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and its successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the people, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military districts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.', 'In addition, these officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except those specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from and appointment to office.In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had been vetoed.On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action, it passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question, the policy endorsed by the people of the country.It was, therefore, my determination to see to the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would endeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced personal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the measures enacted by Congress.Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference with the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them, my invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of absolute necessity.The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout the district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans, for it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission and commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor, John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General of the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus vacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.The officials thus removed had taken upon themselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise such a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.The President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and I replied:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.These removals were made under the powers granted me in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after the investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:  \"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.', 'The records of his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the massacre of July 30.\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot and massacre.', '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.Many of these persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law despite the President\\'s veto on March 23.This was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing methods of registration.I also announced that until elections were held in accordance with these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.There was one parish, Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered there, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.In April.I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing delegate to a Constitutional convention.It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled and thereby filled the representation.The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes a void, removes a stopper.This inadequacy of act to representation is precisely what we here call consciousness.Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the following instructions:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\"Special Orders, No.', '15.\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.Election precincts will remain as at present constituted.\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each person registered.', '\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts, having reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day designated.And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted by another tendency.How, then, could this occur in the domain of life, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies is always implied?Office-hours for registration will be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A. M., and from 4 till 7 P. M.  \"When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district will designate the number of polls and the places where they shall be opened in the election precincts within its district, appoint the commissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting the elections, and will superintend the same.\"They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the different precincts the result of the vote, consolidate the same, and forward it to the commanding general.\"Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to a rigid accountability and will be subject to trial by military commission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct in the performance of their duties.', 'Their rate of compensation and manner of payment will be in accordance with the provisions of sections six and seven of the supplemental act.\"Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on the question as to who are disfranchised by law, registers will give the most rigid interpretation to the law, and exclude from registration every person about whose right to vote there may be a doubt.Any person so excluded who may, under the decision of the Attorney-General, be entitled to vote, shall be permitted to register after that decision is received, due notice of which will be given.\"By command of Major-General P. H.']\n",

      "['The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.They had assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was to take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon himself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention, without restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.Thus encouraged, the element but lately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any intervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such illusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent disappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.The provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling of his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b chosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.The proclamation convening this assemblage also announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were satisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and provided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to be disloyal.As this action of Hamilton\\'s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty oath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious opposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the colored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of the war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.It was greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and as it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless the freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon reported from all parts of the State.Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public opinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.As department commander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions for help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his duties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.By such disposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton, and all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance of an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the duties of the office August 9, 1866.One of Governor Throckmorton\\'s first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of the military.This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson, on the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered control of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that had characterized the beginning of Hamilton\\'s administration.Oppressive legislation in the shape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross injustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and disorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till Congress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation of the seceded States.In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put in operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.This was effected under encouragement given by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at New Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.The constitution then agreed upon was submitted to the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of the State.The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was never recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship by the President\\'s amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.The Legislature was in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President, on the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding civil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began in Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led to flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers of outrages and murders.To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established the government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this by reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening under certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.Therefore, early in the summer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided that a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly by B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.Mayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action as revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling prevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.A bloody riot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called by affairs on the Rio Grande.On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter, General Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government.But our intelligence is not stopped by this.By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is an \"absence of order.\"In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder may indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then the implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which we shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade by denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing the first.How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes?It is no use for us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak of it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as we said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest it, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of the empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies something.But it is this analysis that we neglect to make.We omit it, precisely because it does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.We said, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent.If there are two kinds of order, this contingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have been geometrical.But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of degrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to me to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily believe that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of itself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which there is no order at all.\"And this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because it is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is an unquestionable fact.', 'Div.of the Gulf, \"New Orleans, La.\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do not allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety.Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the facts which occurred.\"U.

that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter would stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions be had.This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary by the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications of their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached me a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19, by an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional only, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled, modified, superseded, or abolished.I also announced that no removals from office would be made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization, or unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization, it is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various branches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and its successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the people, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military districts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.', 'In addition, these officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except those specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from and appointment to office.In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had been vetoed.On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action, it passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question, the policy endorsed by the people of the country.It was, therefore, my determination to see to the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would endeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced personal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the measures enacted by Congress.Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference with the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them, my invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of absolute necessity.The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout the district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans, for it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission and commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor, John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General of the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus vacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.The officials thus removed had taken upon themselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise such a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.The President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and I replied:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.These removals were made under the powers granted me in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after the investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:  \"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.', 'The records of his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the massacre of July 30.\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot and massacre.', '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.Many of these persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law despite the President\\'s veto on March 23.This was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing methods of registration.I also announced that until elections were held in accordance with these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.There was one parish, Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered there, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.In April.I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing delegate to a Constitutional convention.It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled and thereby filled the representation.The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes a void, removes a stopper.This inadequacy of act to representation is precisely what we here call consciousness.Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the following instructions:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\"Special Orders, No.', '15.\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.Election precincts will remain as at present constituted.\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each person registered.', '\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts, having reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day designated.And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted by another tendency.How, then, could this occur in the domain of life, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies is always implied?Office-hours for registration will be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A. M., and from 4 till 7 P. M.  \"When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district will designate the number of polls and the places where they shall be opened in the election precincts within its district, appoint the commissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting the elections, and will superintend the same.\"They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the different precincts the result of the vote, consolidate the same, and forward it to the commanding general.\"Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to a rigid accountability and will be subject to trial by military commission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct in the performance of their duties.', 'Their rate of compensation and manner of payment will be in accordance with the provisions of sections six and seven of the supplemental act.\"Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on the question as to who are disfranchised by law, registers will give the most rigid interpretation to the law, and exclude from registration every person about whose right to vote there may be a doubt.Any person so excluded who may, under the decision of the Attorney-General, be entitled to vote, shall be permitted to register after that decision is received, due notice of which will be given.\"By command of Major-General P. H.']\n",

      "['The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.They had assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was to take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon himself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention, without restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.Thus encouraged, the element but lately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any intervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such illusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent disappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.The provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling of his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b chosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.The proclamation convening this assemblage also announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were satisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and provided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to be disloyal.As this action of Hamilton\\'s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty oath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious opposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the colored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of the war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.It was greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and as it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless the freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon reported from all parts of the State.Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public opinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.As department commander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions for help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his duties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.By such disposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton, and all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance of an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the duties of the office August 9, 1866.One of Governor Throckmorton\\'s first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of the military.This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson, on the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered control of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that had characterized the beginning of Hamilton\\'s administration.Oppressive legislation in the shape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross injustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and disorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till Congress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation of the seceded States.In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put in operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.This was effected under encouragement given by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at New Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.The constitution then agreed upon was submitted to the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of the State.The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was never recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship by the President\\'s amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.The Legislature was in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President, on the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding civil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began in Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led to flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers of outrages and murders.To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established the government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this by reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening under certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.Therefore, early in the summer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided that a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly by B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.Mayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action as revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling prevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.A bloody riot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called by affairs on the Rio Grande.On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter, General Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government.But our intelligence is not stopped by this.By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is an \"absence of order.\"In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder may indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then the implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which we shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade by denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing the first.How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes?It is no use for us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak of it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as we said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest it, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of the empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies something.But it is this analysis that we neglect to make.We omit it, precisely because it does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.We said, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent.If there are two kinds of order, this contingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have been geometrical.But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of degrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to me to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily believe that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of itself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which there is no order at all.\"And this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because it is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is an unquestionable fact.', 'Div.of the Gulf, \"New Orleans, La.\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do not allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety.Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the facts which occurred.\"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"', 'In obedience to the President\\'s directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another, more in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:  \"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, \"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, \"President United States  \"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.A very large number of colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed from the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.The speech of Dostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.The speeches of the others, so far as I can learn, were characterized by moderation.I have not given you the words of Dostie\\'s speech, as the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they were intemperate.\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting themselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.', 'I think there were about twenty-six (26) members present.In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18) or twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty (150).Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of every tenth (10) man.\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored men marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American flag.These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.While crossing Canal Street a row occurred.There were many spectators on the street, and their manner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.This led to other shots and a rush after the procession.On arrival at the front of the Institute there was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.The police, who had been held well in hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.The procession entered the Institute with the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.A row occurred between a policeman and one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to an indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.This had been going on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute, whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen opened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.', 'The door was broken in, and the firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door or were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the circle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens that formed the outer circle.Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.The wounded were stabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.In the yard of the building, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they were fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.Some were killed and wounded several squares from the scene.Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands as prisoners, some of them mortally.\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote cause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since the advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many desperate men, and some of them known murderers.People of clear views were overawed by want of confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police force.I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard them express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.Ever since the intimation of this last convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting, by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test of what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.', 'If this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in other places.No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens who were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.The members of the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.Judge Abell, whose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city.The leading men of the convention--King, Cutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.I regret to say that the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he has shown very little of the man.\"P. H.

Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.These removals were made under the powers granted me in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after the investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:  \"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.', 'The records of his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the massacre of July 30.\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot and massacre.', '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.Many of these persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law despite the President\\'s veto on March 23.This was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing methods of registration.I also announced that until elections were held in accordance with these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.There was one parish, Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered there, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.In April.I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing delegate to a Constitutional convention.It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled and thereby filled the representation.The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes a void, removes a stopper.This inadequacy of act to representation is precisely what we here call consciousness.Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the following instructions:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\"Special Orders, No.', '15.\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.Election precincts will remain as at present constituted.\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each person registered.', '\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts, having reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day designated.And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted by another tendency.How, then, could this occur in the domain of life, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies is always implied?Office-hours for registration will be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A.

      "['The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.They had assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was to take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon himself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention, without restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.Thus encouraged, the element but lately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any intervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such illusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent disappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.The provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling of his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b chosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.The proclamation convening this assemblage also announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were satisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and provided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to be disloyal.As this action of Hamilton\\'s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty oath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious opposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the colored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of the war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.It was greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and as it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless the freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon reported from all parts of the State.Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public opinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.As department commander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions for help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his duties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.By such disposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton, and all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance of an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the duties of the office August 9, 1866.One of Governor Throckmorton\\'s first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of the military.This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson, on the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered control of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that had characterized the beginning of Hamilton\\'s administration.Oppressive legislation in the shape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross injustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and disorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till Congress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation of the seceded States.In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put in operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.This was effected under encouragement given by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at New Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.The constitution then agreed upon was submitted to the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of the State.The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was never recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship by the President\\'s amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.The Legislature was in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President, on the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding civil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began in Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led to flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers of outrages and murders.To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established the government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this by reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening under certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.Therefore, early in the summer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided that a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly by B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.Mayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action as revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling prevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.A bloody riot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called by affairs on the Rio Grande.On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter, General Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government.But our intelligence is not stopped by this.By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is an \"absence of order.\"In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder may indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then the implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which we shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade by denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing the first.How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes?It is no use for us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak of it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as we said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest it, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of the empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies something.But it is this analysis that we neglect to make.We omit it, precisely because it does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.We said, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent.If there are two kinds of order, this contingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have been geometrical.But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of degrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to me to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily believe that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of itself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which there is no order at all.\"And this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because it is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is an unquestionable fact.', 'Div.of the Gulf, \"New Orleans, La.\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do not allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety.Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the facts which occurred.\"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"', 'In obedience to the President\\'s directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another, more in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:  \"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, \"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, \"President United States  \"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.A very large number of colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed from the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.The speech of Dostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.The speeches of the others, so far as I can learn, were characterized by moderation.I have not given you the words of Dostie\\'s speech, as the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they were intemperate.\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting themselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.', 'I think there were about twenty-six (26) members present.In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18) or twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty (150).Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of every tenth (10) man.\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored men marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American flag.These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.While crossing Canal Street a row occurred.There were many spectators on the street, and their manner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.This led to other shots and a rush after the procession.On arrival at the front of the Institute there was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.The police, who had been held well in hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.The procession entered the Institute with the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.A row occurred between a policeman and one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to an indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.This had been going on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute, whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen opened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.', 'The door was broken in, and the firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door or were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the circle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens that formed the outer circle.Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.The wounded were stabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.In the yard of the building, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they were fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.Some were killed and wounded several squares from the scene.Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands as prisoners, some of them mortally.\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote cause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since the advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many desperate men, and some of them known murderers.People of clear views were overawed by want of confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police force.I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard them express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.Ever since the intimation of this last convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting, by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test of what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.', 'If this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in other places.No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens who were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.The members of the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.Judge Abell, whose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city.The leading men of the convention--King, Cutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.I regret to say that the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he has shown very little of the man.\"P. H. SHERIDAN, \"Major-General Commanding.\"Subsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal of testimony.', 'The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches, and still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives, of which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B. M. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.The majority report of the committee also corroborated, in all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.The committee likewise called attention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging the origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted and unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"A list of the killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions reached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who came together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....There has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute of justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took place at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.The statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that \\'rebels\\' and \\'thugs\\' and disloyal men had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police force.\"The committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary establishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime the safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their protection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.\"', 'The New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served to intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson\\'s policy of reconstruction, a policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was made plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States under conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to say, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated slaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.SCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.LAFAYETTE S.

WADE, President of the Senate pro tempore.CHAPTER XI.PASSAGE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ACT OVER THE PRESIDENT\\'S VETO--PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT--REMOVING OFFICERS--MY REASONS FOR SUCH ACTION--AFFAIRS IN LOUISIANA AND TEXAS--REMOVAL OF GOVERNOR WELLS--REVISION OF THE JURY LISTS--RELIEVED FROM THE COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.The first of the Reconstruction laws was passed March 2, 1867, and though vetoed by the President, such was the unanimity of loyal sentiment and the urgency demanding the measure, that the bill became a law over the veto the day the President returned it to Congress.March the 11th this law was published in General Orders No.10, from the Headquarters of the Army, the same order assigning certain officers to take charge of the five military districts into which the States lately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the commander of the Fifth Military District, which embraced Louisiana and Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion of my command since the close of the war.Between the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana Legislature, then in special session, had rejected a proposed repeal of an Act it had previously passed providing for an election of certain municipal officers in New Orleans.This election was set for March 11, but the mayor and the chief of police, together with General Mower, commanding the troops in the city, having expressed to me personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed by the election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the district, assuming the authority which the Act conferred on district commanders, declared that the election should not take place; that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter would stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions be had.This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary by the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications of their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached me a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19, by an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional only, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled, modified, superseded, or abolished.I also announced that no removals from office would be made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization, or unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization, it is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various branches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and its successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the people, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military districts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.', 'In addition, these officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except those specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from and appointment to office.In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had been vetoed.On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action, it passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question, the policy endorsed by the people of the country.It was, therefore, my determination to see to the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would endeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced personal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the measures enacted by Congress.Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference with the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them, my invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of absolute necessity.The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout the district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans, for it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission and commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor, John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General of the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus vacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.The officials thus removed had taken upon themselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise such a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.The President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and I replied:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.These removals were made under the powers granted me in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after the investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:  \"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.', 'The records of his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the massacre of July 30.\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot and massacre.', '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.Many of these persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law despite the President\\'s veto on March 23.This was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing methods of registration.I also announced that until elections were held in accordance with these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.There was one parish, Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered there, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.In April.I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing delegate to a Constitutional convention.It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled and thereby filled the representation.The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes a void, removes a stopper.This inadequacy of act to representation is precisely what we here call consciousness.Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the following instructions:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\"Special Orders, No.', '15.\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.Election precincts will remain as at present constituted.\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each person registered.', '\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts, having reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day designated.And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted by another tendency.How, then, could this occur in the domain of life, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies is always implied?Office-hours for registration will be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A.

      "['The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.They had assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was to take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon himself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention, without restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.Thus encouraged, the element but lately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any intervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such illusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent disappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.The provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling of his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b chosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.The proclamation convening this assemblage also announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were satisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and provided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to be disloyal.As this action of Hamilton\\'s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty oath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious opposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the colored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of the war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.It was greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and as it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless the freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon reported from all parts of the State.Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public opinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.As department commander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions for help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his duties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.By such disposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton, and all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance of an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the duties of the office August 9, 1866.One of Governor Throckmorton\\'s first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of the military.This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson, on the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered control of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that had characterized the beginning of Hamilton\\'s administration.Oppressive legislation in the shape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross injustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and disorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till Congress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation of the seceded States.In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put in operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.This was effected under encouragement given by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at New Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.The constitution then agreed upon was submitted to the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of the State.The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was never recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship by the President\\'s amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.The Legislature was in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President, on the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding civil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began in Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led to flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers of outrages and murders.To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established the government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this by reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening under certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.Therefore, early in the summer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided that a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly by B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.Mayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action as revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling prevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.A bloody riot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called by affairs on the Rio Grande.On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter, General Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government.But our intelligence is not stopped by this.By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is an \"absence of order.\"In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder may indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then the implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which we shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade by denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing the first.How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes?It is no use for us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak of it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as we said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest it, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of the empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies something.But it is this analysis that we neglect to make.We omit it, precisely because it does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.We said, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent.If there are two kinds of order, this contingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have been geometrical.But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of degrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to me to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily believe that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of itself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which there is no order at all.\"And this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because it is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is an unquestionable fact.', 'Div.of the Gulf, \"New Orleans, La.\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do not allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety.Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the facts which occurred.\"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"', 'In obedience to the President\\'s directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another, more in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:  \"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, \"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, \"President United States  \"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.A very large number of colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed from the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.The speech of Dostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.The speeches of the others, so far as I can learn, were characterized by moderation.I have not given you the words of Dostie\\'s speech, as the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they were intemperate.\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting themselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.', 'I think there were about twenty-six (26) members present.In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18) or twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty (150).Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of every tenth (10) man.\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored men marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American flag.These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.While crossing Canal Street a row occurred.There were many spectators on the street, and their manner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.This led to other shots and a rush after the procession.On arrival at the front of the Institute there was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.The police, who had been held well in hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.The procession entered the Institute with the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.A row occurred between a policeman and one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to an indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.This had been going on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute, whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen opened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.', 'The door was broken in, and the firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door or were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the circle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens that formed the outer circle.Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.The wounded were stabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.In the yard of the building, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they were fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.Some were killed and wounded several squares from the scene.Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands as prisoners, some of them mortally.\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote cause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since the advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many desperate men, and some of them known murderers.People of clear views were overawed by want of confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police force.I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard them express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.Ever since the intimation of this last convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting, by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test of what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.', 'If this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in other places.No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens who were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.The members of the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.Judge Abell, whose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city.The leading men of the convention--King, Cutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.I regret to say that the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he has shown very little of the man.\"P. H. SHERIDAN, \"Major-General Commanding.\"Subsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal of testimony.', 'The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches, and still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives, of which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B. M. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.The majority report of the committee also corroborated, in all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.The committee likewise called attention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging the origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted and unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"A list of the killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions reached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who came together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....There has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute of justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took place at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.The statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that \\'rebels\\' and \\'thugs\\' and disloyal men had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police force.\"The committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary establishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime the safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their protection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.\"', 'The New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served to intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson\\'s policy of reconstruction, a policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was made plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States under conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to say, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated slaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.SCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.LAFAYETTE S.

WADE, President of the Senate pro tempore.CHAPTER XI.PASSAGE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ACT OVER THE PRESIDENT\\'S VETO--PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT--REMOVING OFFICERS--MY REASONS FOR SUCH ACTION--AFFAIRS IN LOUISIANA AND TEXAS--REMOVAL OF GOVERNOR WELLS--REVISION OF THE JURY LISTS--RELIEVED FROM THE COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.The first of the Reconstruction laws was passed March 2, 1867, and though vetoed by the President, such was the unanimity of loyal sentiment and the urgency demanding the measure, that the bill became a law over the veto the day the President returned it to Congress.March the 11th this law was published in General Orders No.10, from the Headquarters of the Army, the same order assigning certain officers to take charge of the five military districts into which the States lately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the commander of the Fifth Military District, which embraced Louisiana and Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion of my command since the close of the war.Between the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana Legislature, then in special session, had rejected a proposed repeal of an Act it had previously passed providing for an election of certain municipal officers in New Orleans.This election was set for March 11, but the mayor and the chief of police, together with General Mower, commanding the troops in the city, having expressed to me personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed by the election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the district, assuming the authority which the Act conferred on district commanders, declared that the election should not take place; that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter would stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions be had.This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary by the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications of their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached me a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19, by an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional only, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled, modified, superseded, or abolished.I also announced that no removals from office would be made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization, or unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization, it is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various branches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and its successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the people, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military districts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.', 'In addition, these officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except those specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from and appointment to office.In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had been vetoed.On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action, it passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question, the policy endorsed by the people of the country.It was, therefore, my determination to see to the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would endeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced personal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the measures enacted by Congress.Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference with the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them, my invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of absolute necessity.The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout the district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans, for it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission and commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor, John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General of the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus vacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.The officials thus removed had taken upon themselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise such a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.The President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and I replied:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.These removals were made under the powers granted me in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after the investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:  \"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.', 'The records of his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the massacre of July 30.\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot and massacre.', '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.Many of these persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law despite the President\\'s veto on March 23.This was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing methods of registration.I also announced that until elections were held in accordance with these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.There was one parish, Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered there, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.In April.I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing delegate to a Constitutional convention.It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled and thereby filled the representation.The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes a void, removes a stopper.This inadequacy of act to representation is precisely what we here call consciousness.Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the following instructions:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\"Special Orders, No.', '15.\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.Election precincts will remain as at present constituted.\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each person registered.', '\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts, having reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day designated.And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted by another tendency.How, then, could this occur in the domain of life, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies is always implied?Office-hours for registration will be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A. M., and from 4 till 7 P. M.  \"When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district will designate the number of polls and the places where they shall be opened in the election precincts within its district, appoint the commissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting the elections, and will superintend the same.\"They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the different precincts the result of the vote, consolidate the same, and forward it to the commanding general.\"Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to a rigid accountability and will be subject to trial by military commission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct in the performance of their duties.', 'Their rate of compensation and manner of payment will be in accordance with the provisions of sections six and seven of the supplemental act.\"Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on the question as to who are disfranchised by law, registers will give the most rigid interpretation to the law, and exclude from registration every person about whose right to vote there may be a doubt.Any person so excluded who may, under the decision of the Attorney-General, be entitled to vote, shall be permitted to register after that decision is received, due notice of which will be given.\"By command of Major-General P.

Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action as revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling prevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.A bloody riot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called by affairs on the Rio Grande.On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter, General Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government.But our intelligence is not stopped by this.By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is an \"absence of order.\"In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder may indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then the implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which we shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade by denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing the first.How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes?It is no use for us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak of it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as we said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest it, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of the empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies something.But it is this analysis that we neglect to make.We omit it, precisely because it does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.We said, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent.If there are two kinds of order, this contingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have been geometrical.But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of degrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to me to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily believe that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of itself, that is to say by relation to a state of things \"in which there is no order at all.\"And this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because it is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is an unquestionable fact.', 'Div.of the Gulf, \"New Orleans, La.\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do not allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety.Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the facts which occurred.\"U. S. GRANT, \"Lieutenant-General.\"', 'In obedience to the President\\'s directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another, more in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:  \"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, \"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, \"President United States  \"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.A very large number of colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed from the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.The speech of Dostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.The speeches of the others, so far as I can learn, were characterized by moderation.I have not given you the words of Dostie\\'s speech, as the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they were intemperate.\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting themselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.', 'I think there were about twenty-six (26) members present.In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18) or twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty (150).Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of every tenth (10) man.\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored men marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American flag.These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.While crossing Canal Street a row occurred.There were many spectators on the street, and their manner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.This led to other shots and a rush after the procession.On arrival at the front of the Institute there was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.The police, who had been held well in hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.The procession entered the Institute with the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.A row occurred between a policeman and one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to an indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.This had been going on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute, whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen opened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.', 'The door was broken in, and the firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door or were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the circle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens that formed the outer circle.Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.The wounded were stabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.In the yard of the building, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they were fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.Some were killed and wounded several squares from the scene.Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands as prisoners, some of them mortally.\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote cause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since the advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many desperate men, and some of them known murderers.People of clear views were overawed by want of confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police force.I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard them express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.Ever since the intimation of this last convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting, by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test of what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.', 'If this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in other places.No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens who were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.The members of the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.Judge Abell, whose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city.The leading men of the convention--King, Cutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.I regret to say that the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he has shown very little of the man.\"P. H. SHERIDAN, \"Major-General Commanding.\"Subsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal of testimony.', 'The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches, and still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives, of which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B. M. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.The majority report of the committee also corroborated, in all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.The committee likewise called attention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging the origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that \"it was an unwarranted and unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.\"A list of the killed and wounded was embraced in the committee\\'s report, and among other conclusions reached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who came together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....There has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute of justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took place at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.The statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that \\'rebels\\' and \\'thugs\\' and disloyal men had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police force.\"The committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary establishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime the safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their protection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.\"', 'The New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served to intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson\\'s policy of reconstruction, a policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was made plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States under conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to say, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated slaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.SCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.LAFAYETTE S. FOSTER, President of the Senate pro tempore.SCHUYLER COLFAX, Speaker of the House of Representatives.B. F. WADE, President of the Senate pro tempore.CHAPTER XI.PASSAGE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ACT OVER THE PRESIDENT\\'S VETO--PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT--REMOVING OFFICERS--MY REASONS FOR SUCH ACTION--AFFAIRS IN LOUISIANA AND TEXAS--REMOVAL OF GOVERNOR WELLS--REVISION OF THE JURY LISTS--RELIEVED FROM THE COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.The first of the Reconstruction laws was passed March 2, 1867, and though vetoed by the President, such was the unanimity of loyal sentiment and the urgency demanding the measure, that the bill became a law over the veto the day the President returned it to Congress.March the 11th this law was published in General Orders No.10, from the Headquarters of the Army, the same order assigning certain officers to take charge of the five military districts into which the States lately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the commander of the Fifth Military District, which embraced Louisiana and Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion of my command since the close of the war.Between the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana Legislature, then in special session, had rejected a proposed repeal of an Act it had previously passed providing for an election of certain municipal officers in New Orleans.This election was set for March 11, but the mayor and the chief of police, together with General Mower, commanding the troops in the city, having expressed to me personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed by the election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the district, assuming the authority which the Act conferred on district commanders, declared that the election should not take place; that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter would stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions be had.This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary by the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications of their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached me a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19, by an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional only, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled, modified, superseded, or abolished.I also announced that no removals from office would be made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization, or unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the reorganization, it is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various branches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and its successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the people, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.\"Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military districts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.', 'In addition, these officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except those specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from and appointment to office.In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had been vetoed.On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President\\'s adverse action, it passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question, the policy endorsed by the people of the country.It was, therefore, my determination to see to the law\\'s zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would endeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced personal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the measures enacted by Congress.Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference with the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them, my invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of absolute necessity.The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout the district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans, for it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission and commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor, John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General of the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus vacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.The officials thus removed had taken upon themselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise such a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.The President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and I replied:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, \"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.These removals were made under the powers granted me in what is usually termed the \\'military bill,\\' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after the investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:  \"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.', 'The records of his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the massacre of July 30.\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot and massacre.', '\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.Many of these persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law despite the President\\'s veto on March 23.This was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing methods of registration.I also announced that until elections were held in accordance with these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.There was one parish, Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered there, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.In April.I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing delegate to a Constitutional convention.It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled and thereby filled the representation.The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes a void, removes a stopper.This inadequacy of act to representation is precisely what we here call consciousness.Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the following instructions:  \"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\"Special Orders, No.', '15.\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.Election precincts will remain as at present constituted.\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each person registered.', '\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts, having reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day designated.And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted by another tendency.How, then, could this occur in the domain of life, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies is always implied?Office-hours for registration will be from 8 o\\'clock till 12 A. M., and from 4 till 7 P. M.  \"When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district will designate the number of polls and the places where they shall be opened in the election precincts within its district, appoint the commissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting the elections, and will superintend the same.\"They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the different precincts the result of the vote, consolidate the same, and forward it to the commanding general.\"Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to a rigid accountability and will be subject to trial by military commission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct in the performance of their duties.', 'Their rate of compensation and manner of payment will be in accordance with the provisions of sections six and seven of the supplemental act.\"Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on the question as to who are disfranchised by law, registers will give the most rigid interpretation to the law, and exclude from registration every person about whose right to vote there may be a doubt.Any person so excluded who may, under the decision of the Attorney-General, be entitled to vote, shall be permitted to register after that decision is received, due notice of which will be given.\"By command of Major-General P. H.']\n"
