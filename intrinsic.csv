0,suspicious-document00001.txt,"The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among the people of Texas.  They
had assumed that affairs were to go on as of old, and that the reintegration of the State was
to take place under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had taken it upon
himself, together with the Legislature, to authorize the election of delegates to a State Convention,
without restriction as to who should be entitled to vote.  Thus encouraged, the element but
lately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the State to the Union without any
intervention whatever of the Federal Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such
illusions, since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in question, whose consequent
disappointment and chagrin were so great as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.
The provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray, prohibited the assembling
of his convention, and shortly after called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b
chosen by voters who could take the amnesty-oath.  The proclamation convening this assemblage
also announced the policy that would be pursued in governing the State until its affairs were
satisfactorily reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the Judiciary, and
provided for the appointment, by the Governor, of county officials to succeed those known to
be disloyal.  As this action of Hamilton's disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty
oath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with pronounced and serious
opposition, and he quickly realized that he had on his hands an arduous task to protect the
colored people, particularly as in the transition state of society just after the close of
the war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented itself chiefly on the freedmen.  It
was greatly feared that political rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and
as it was generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race war unless
the freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of subjection, acts of intimidation were soon
reported from all parts of the State.

Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb this terrorism, but public
opinion being strong against him, he could accomplish little without military aid.  As department
commander, I was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as these requisitions
for help became necessarily very frequent, the result was that shortly after he assumed his
duties, detachments of troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.  By such
disposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the administration of Hamilton,
and all went well till the inauguration of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance
of an authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called together, assumed the
duties of the office August 9, 1866.

One of Governor Throckmorton's first acts was to ask the withdrawal or non-interference of
the military.  This was not all granted, but under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson,
on the 13th of August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with the unhampered
control of civil affairs, and this was more than enough to revive the bulldozing methods that
had characterized the beginning of Hamilton's administration.  Oppressive legislation in the
shape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed, developing a policy of gross
injustice toward the colored people on the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and
disorder ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least, continued till
Congress, by what are known as the Reconstruction Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation
of the seceded States.

In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the loyal element, had been put
in operation, as already mentioned, as early as 1864.  This was effected under encouragement
given by President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention, which met at
New Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.  The constitution then agreed upon was submitted
to the people, and in September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of
the State.

The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as provisional merely, was
never recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the returned Confederates, restored to citizenship
by the President's amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.  The Legislature
was in their hands, as well as most of the State and municipal offices; so, when the President,
on the 20th of August, 1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding
civil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded States, there at once began
in Louisiana a system of discriminative legislation directed against the freedmen, that led
to flagrant wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote parishes to numbers
of outrages and murders.

To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by those who had established
the government of 1864, to remodel the constitution of the State; and they sought to do this
by reassembling the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for reconvening
under certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its president.  Therefore, early in the
summer of 1866, many members of this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided
that a necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation was issued accordingly
by B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.

Mayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked upon this proposed action
as revolutionary, and by the time the convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling
prevailed that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the meeting.  A bloody
riot followed, resulting, in the killing and wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.

I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from Texas, where I had been called
by affairs on the Rio Grande.  On my way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on
the night of July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving the details
of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing me that, to prevent further slaughter,
General Baird, the senior military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal government. But
our intelligence is not stopped by this. By a simple sic jubeo it posits a disorder which is
an ""absence of order.""

In so doing it thinks a word or a set of words, nothing more.

If it seeks to attach an idea to the word, it finds that disorder
may indeed be the negation of order, but that this negation is then
the implicit affirmation of the presence of the opposite order, which
we shut our eyes to because it does not interest us, or which we evade
by denying the second order in its turn--that is, at bottom, by re-establishing
the first.

How can we speak, then, of an incoherent diversity which an understanding organizes? It is no use
for us to say that no one supposes this incoherence to be realized or realizable: when we speak
of it, we believe we are thinking of it; now, in analyzing the idea actually present, we find, as
we said before, only the disappointment of the mind confronted with an order that does not interest
it, or a swaying of the mind between two kinds of order, or, finally, the idea pure and simple of
the empty word that we have created by joining a negative prefix to a word which itself signifies
something. But it is this analysis that we neglect to make. We omit it, precisely because
it does not occur to us to distinguish two kinds of order that are irreducible to one another.

We
said, indeed, that all order necessarily appears as contingent. If there are two kinds of order, this
contingency of order is explained: one of the forms is contingent in relation to the other.
Where I find the geometrical order, the vital was possible; where the order is vital, it might have
been geometrical. But suppose that the order is everywhere of the same kind, and simply admits of
degrees which go from the geometrical to the vital: if a determinate order still appears to
me to be contingent, and can no longer be so by relation to an order of another kind, I shall necessarily
believe that the order is contingent by relation to an absence of
itself, that is to say by relation to a state of things ""in which
there is no order at all.""

And this state of things I shall believe that I am thinking of, because
it is implied, it seems, in the very contingency of order, which is
an unquestionable fact.

""Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to preserve the peace; and do
not allow any of the civil authorities to act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public
safety.  Lose no time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot, and the
facts which occurred.

""U. S. GRANT, ""Lieutenant-General.""

In obedience to the President's directions, My report of August 1 was followed by another,
more in detail, which I give in full, since it tells the whole story of the riot:

""HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF, ""NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.

""His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON, ""President United States

""I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of August 4.  A very large number
of colored people marched in procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were addressed
from the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor Hahn, and others.  The speech of
Dostie was intemperate in language and sentiment.  The speeches of the others, so far as I
can learn, were characterized by moderation.  I have not given you the words of Dostie's speech,
as the version published was denied; but from what I have learned of the man, I believe they
were intemperate.

""The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30), the timid members absenting
themselves because the tone of the general public was ominous of trouble.  I think there were
about twenty-six (26) members present.  In front of the Mechanics Institute, where the meeting
was held, there were assembled some colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18)
or twenty (20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one hundred and fifty
(150).  Among those outside and inside there might have been a pistol in the possession of
every tenth (10) man.

""About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one hundred and thirty (130) colored
men marched up Burgundy Street and across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American
flag. These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs in addition.  While
crossing Canal Street a row occurred.  There were many spectators on the street, and their
manner and tone toward the procession unfriendly.  A shot was fired, by whom I am not able
to state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored man in the procession.
This led to other shots and a rush after the procession.  On arrival at the front of the Institute
there was some throwing of brickbats by both sides.  The police, who had been held well in
hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.  The procession entered the Institute
with the flag, about six (6) or eight (8) remaining outside.  A row occurred between a policeman
and one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the parties, which led to
an indiscriminate fire on the building through the windows by the policemen.  This had been
going on for a short time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the Institute,
whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into the building.

""From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the building, the policemen
opened an indiscriminate fire upon the audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when
they retired, and those inside barricaded the doors.  The door was broken in, and the firing
again commenced, when many of the colored and white people either escaped throughout the door
or were passed out by the policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the
circle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again fired upon by the citizens
that formed the outer circle.  Many of those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were
prisoners and not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.  The wounded were
stabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads beaten with brickbats.  In the yard of the
building, whither some of the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they
were fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.  Some were killed and wounded several squares
from the scene.  Members of the convention were wounded by the police while in their hands
as prisoners, some of them mortally.

""The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of this Convention; the remote
cause was the bitter and antagonistic feeling which has been growing in this community since
the advent of the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force, selected many
desperate men, and some of them known murderers. People of clear views were overawed by want
of confidence in the Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his police
force.  I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens on this subject, and have heard
them express fear, and want of confidence in Mayor Monroe.  Ever since the intimation of this
last convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city papers for supporting,
by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad men.  As to the merciless manner in which the
convention was broken up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.

""It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a great many here toward
Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has so precipitated matters that there is now a test
of what shall be the status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in constant
dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and property, and have justice in the courts.
If this matter is permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution of those
engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the same kind, not only here, but in
other places.  No steps have as yet been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens
who were engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such cruelties.  The members
of the convention have been indicted by the grand jury, and many of them arrested and held
to bail.  As to whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the guilty parties
on both sides, I must say it is my opinion, unequivocally, that they cannot.  Judge Abell,
whose course I have closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most dangerous
men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city. The leading men of the convention--King,
Cutler, Hahn, and others --have been political agitators, and are bad men.  I regret to say
that the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the late trouble he
has shown very little of the man.

""P. H. SHERIDAN, ""Major-General Commanding.""

Subsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the riot, taking a great deal
of testimony.  The commission substantially confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches,
and still later there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of Representatives,
of which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B.
M. Boyer, of Pennsylvania, were the members.  The majority report of the committee also corroborated,
in all essentials, my reports of the distressing occurrence.  The committee likewise called
attention to a violent speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging
the origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech that ""it was an unwarranted
and unjust expression of hostile feeling, without pretext or foundation in fact.""  A list of
the killed and wounded was embraced in the committee's report, and among other conclusions
reached were the following: ""That the meeting of July 30 was a meeting of quiet citizens, who
came together without arms and with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....
There has been no occasion during our National history when a riot has occurred so destitute
of justifiable cause, resulting in a massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took
place at New Orleans on the 30th of July last.

The statement is also made, that, ""He [the President] knew that 'rebels' and 'thugs' and disloyal
men had controlled the election of Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police
force.""

The committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and recommended the temporary
establishment of a provisional government therein; the report concluding that ""in the meantime
the safety of all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed for their
protection, for the well being of the nation and the permanent peace of the Republic.""

The New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and other reports served
to intensify and concentrate the opposition to President Johnson's policy of reconstruction,
a policy resting exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it was
made plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to rehabilitate the seceded States
under conditions differing not a whit from those existing before the rebellion; that is to
say, without the slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the emancipated
slaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who had remained loyal in the war.

CHAPTER XI.

PASSAGE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ACT OVER THE PRESIDENT'S VETO--PLACED IN COMMAND OF THE FIFTH
MILITARY DISTRICT--REMOVING OFFICERS--MY REASONS FOR SUCH ACTION--AFFAIRS IN LOUISIANA AND
TEXAS--REMOVAL OF GOVERNOR WELLS--REVISION OF THE JURY LISTS--RELIEVED FROM THE COMMAND OF
THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.

The first of the Reconstruction laws was passed March 2, 1867, and though vetoed by the President,
such was the unanimity of loyal sentiment and the urgency demanding the measure, that the bill
became a law over the veto the day the President returned it to Congress. March the 11th this
law was published in General Orders No. 10, from the Headquarters of the Army, the same order
assigning certain officers to take charge of the five military districts into which the States
lately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the commander of the Fifth Military
District, which embraced Louisiana and Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion
of my command since the close of the war.

Between the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana Legislature, then in special
session, had rejected a proposed repeal of an Act it had previously passed providing for an
election of certain municipal officers in New Orleans.  This election was set for March 11,
but the mayor and the chief of police, together with General Mower, commanding the troops in
the city, having expressed to me personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed
by the election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the district, assuming the
authority which the Act conferred on district commanders, declared that the election should
not take place; that no polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter
would stand postponed till the district commander should be appointed, or special instructions
be had.  This, my first official act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary
by the course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give unequivocal indications
of their intention to ignore the laws of Congress.

A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with my assignment, having reached
me a few days after, I regularly assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19,
by an order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the district to be provisional
only, and, under the provisions of the sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled,
modified, superseded, or abolished.  I also announced that no removals from office would be
made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the provisions of the law or impeded reorganization,
or unless willful delays should necessitate a change, and added: ""Pending the reorganization,
it is, desirable and intended to create as little disturbance in the machinery of the various
branches of the provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of Congress and
its successful execution, but this condition is dependent upon the disposition shown by the
people, and upon the length of time required for reorganization.""

Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former designations as military
districts, the officers in command exercising their military powers as heretofore.  In addition,
these officers were to carry out in their respective commands all provisions of the law except
those specially requiring the action of the district commander, and in cases of removals from
and appointment to office.

In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have heretofore noted, had
been vetoed.  On the very day of the veto, however, despite the President's adverse action,
it passed each House of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it the
effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of reconstruction presented was, beyond question,
the policy endorsed by the people of the country.  It was, therefore, my determination to see
to the law's zealous execution in my district, though I felt certain that the President would
endeavor to embarrass me by every means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced
personal hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but to obstruct the
measures enacted by Congress.

Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my guidance, the principle of non-interference
with the provisional State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me rescind
rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some presupposed action to be taken by them,
my invariable reply was that I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of
absolute necessity.  The same policy was announced also in reference to municipal affairs throughout
the district, so long as the action of the local officers did not conflict with the law.

In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in municipal matters in New Orleans,
for it had become clearly apparent that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission
and commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from office the Mayor,
John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General
of the State, Andrew S. Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus
vacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.  The officials thus removed had taken upon
themselves from the start to pronounce the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise
such a course of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace them by men
in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my determination to have its provisions enforced.
The President at once made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal, and
I replied:

""HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT, ""New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.

""GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge E. Abell, of the Criminal
Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John
T. Monroe, Mayor of the City of New Orleans.  These removals were made under the powers granted
me in what is usually termed the 'military bill,' passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of
the United States.

""I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of these men, especially after
the investigations made by the military board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report
of the congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has been made for
the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as follows:

""The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court in the city of New Orleans,
and for a period of at least nine months previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating
a large portion of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost promising no
prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case such an event occurred.  The records
of his court will show that he fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.

""In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana, I considered
it his duty to indict these men before this criminal court.  This he failed to do, but went
so far as to attempt to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the victims
of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making the innocent guilty and the guilty
innocent.  He was therefore, in my belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on
the massacre of July 30.

""Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when backed by an attorney-general
who would not prosecute the guilty, and a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent
guilty and let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force in the riot
and massacre.

""With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst elements of the population
of this city, giving to those elements an immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief
will see how insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions in the troubles
which might occur in registration and voting in the reorganization of this State.  Many of
these persons were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies, doing their
work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson knew of my official acts before I could
report them to General Grant.

The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of reconstruction became a law
despite the President's veto on March 23. This was a curative act, authorizing elections and
prescribing methods of registration.  I also announced that until elections were held in accordance
with these acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the holding over of
those persons whose terms of office otherwise would have expired, would govern in all cases
excepting only those special ones in which I myself might take action.  There was one parish,
Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the election previously ordered
there, and which therefore took place, but by a supplemental order this election was declare
null and void.

In April.  I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law, which, under  certain condition
of eligibility, required a registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing
delegate to a Constitutional convention. It was there, but neutralized by the action which fulfilled
and thereby filled the representation. The obstacle creates nothing positive; it simply makes
a void, removes a stopper. This inadequacy of act to representation
is precisely what we here call consciousness.  Before
announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised definitely as to what persons were disfranchised
by the law, and was directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it, pending
an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr. Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance
of the boards, I gave the following instructions:

""HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT. ""New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.

""Special Orders, No. 15.

""The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the Parish of Orleans, right bank
(Algiers), will each constitute a Registration district.  Election precincts will remain as
at present constituted.

""....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his duties, will file in the
office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth
section of the Act referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the provisions
of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering the oath therein prescribed to each
person registered.

""Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within their respective districts,
having reference to convenience and facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties
on the day designated. And a tendency achieves all that it aims at only if it is not thwarted
by another tendency. How, then, could this occur in the domain of
life, where, as we shall show, the interaction of antagonistic tendencies
is always implied?  Office-hours for registration
will be from 8 o'clock till 12 A. M., and from 4 till 7 P. M.

""When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district will designate the number
of polls and the places where they shall be opened in the election precincts within its district,
appoint the commissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting the elections,
and will superintend the same.

""They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the different precincts the
result of the vote, consolidate the same, and forward it to the commanding general.

""Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to a rigid accountability
and will be subject to trial by military commission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct
in the performance of their duties.  Their rate of compensation and manner of payment will
be in accordance with the provisions of sections six and seven of the supplemental act.

""Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on the question as to who
are disfranchised by law, registers will give the most rigid interpretation to the law, and
exclude from registration every person about whose right to vote there may be a doubt.  Any
person so excluded who may, under the decision of the Attorney-General, be entitled to vote,
shall be permitted to register after that decision is received, due notice of which will be given.

TO READERS.

The publishers of ""WOMAN MAN'S EQUAL"" conscientiously feel that they are placing before the
public the discussion of one of the most important topics of the day; and they indulge the
strong conviction that the author of this little volume presents this important topic in a
manner at once attractive and convincing. The teachings of nature, history, and the Word of
God are freely drafted, and skillfully arranged to show what nature designed, what God has
taught, and what woman has proved herself capable of being and doing in the world. The abuses
to which the sex has been subject from the physically stronger ""lords of creation,"" in heathen
nations and in brute ages, are ably and fully set forth.

The lessons of the past are the teachings of the future. Christianity has enlarged woman's
area, and multiplied her duties and responsibilities. America is ahead of all other nations
in opportunities offered to woman. Public sentiment is in favor of enlarging her sphere, and
woman is venturing into hitherto untried avenues of employment and usefulness. This is an age
of experiment. An ounce of experiment is worth a pound of theory. Woman's capacity will first
be tested; and, if found equal to the opportunity, no door will be closed against her. She
may preach, orate, lecture, teach, practice medicine or law or politics; may vote, marshal
armies, navigate ships, and go sailoring or soldiering to her heart's content, and at her own
good-will and pleasure, if she only proves to the age that she has ability to do and dare in
all these directions. This is an age of discovery, as well as of experiment; and man is daily
waking up, applying, and marshaling new forces for the benefit of the race. Steam, light, electricity,
magnetism, mechanics, have all contributed of their boundless capacities to human welfare.
Man is gradually coming to be aware that, in the latent powers of woman, only just now on the
eve of development, half the capacities of the human race, like the powers of steam and lightning,
have slumbered, until now, from the beginning of the creation. A new era is dawning upon the
world. This little volume is one of the rays that herald the coming sun.

INTRODUCTION.

Christianity is the special friend of woman. Christian civilization has exalted her almost
infinitely above the position to which either paganism or Mohammedanism assigned her. This
elevation is the natural outgrowth of the example and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth. Unlike
other ancient great instructors, he did not repel women from discipleship, but cordially welcomed
her presence wherever he taught. His lessons of wisdom, and his precious promises of life everlasting,
were in all their fullness addressed to her as freely as to the most honored of men. His illustrations
of sweeping the house to find the lost piece of silver, and of the leaven hid in three measures
of meal, were drawn from her employments, and were probably suggested by her presence. To the
cry of the poor Syro-Phenician woman, no less than to that of the centurion or nobleman, did
he give his attention and sympathy, and with equal speed did he answer the agonizing prayer.
Rising far above the trammels of Jewish prejudice, while he sat weary at the mouth of Jacob's
well, he taught the beauty of spiritual worship to the astonished woman of Samaria. She became
his first missionary to the people of her city, to whom she told the story of his wonderful
wisdom, and said, ""Is not this the Christ?"" How kind must have been his spirit, how tender
his words, to the sisters at Bethany, to cause the exclamation, ""If thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died!"" How consoling must have been his accents, which drew the fair penitent
to his feet, and which led her, in loving adoration, to wash them with her tears and to wipe
them with the hairs of her head! How wonderful the manifestation of that Divine condescension
and love which elicited that gratitude which still lingers in the rich perfumes of the alabaster-box
of precious ointment! No marvel that women ""followed him from Galilee,"" stood sorrowfully beholding
his crucifixion, and when he was taken from the cross, ""followed after and beheld the sepulcher,
and how his body was laid."" Their devotion was rewarded, on the morning of his resurrection,
by their being made the first messengers of his glorious triumph. On such perfect equality
were men and women placed by the blessed Savior as to terms of salvation and Gospel privileges,
that the apostle exclaims, ""In Christ Jesus there is neither male nor female."" All are members
of his body, and in him all become one.

As Christian influences more fully control society, and as the spirit of Christ permeates the
masses, the position of woman becomes more elevated. She is no longer considered as a slave,
and compelled to bear every burden, as in savage life; nor is she a mere attendant, or minister
to sensual pleasure, as among the Mohammedans. The bars are removed from the doors of the harem,
and the veil is taken from her face. She sits with the family at the table, entertains her
guests, and enjoys their society. She studies with her brothers in the same school, recites
to the same teachers, and reads the same books. With her friends, she joins in the service
and song and worship of, the sanctuary, converses in the social assembly, and listens to distinguished
speakers as they discuss topics of literature, art, science, or statesmanship. The cry of suffering
humanity touches her heart, and she is deeply interested in the great movements toward the
elevation of the race. In this ascent, every step she has taken has been in opposition to the
protest of the spirit of other civilizations, which yet lurks in many a breast. To be seen
by strangers, to have her face unveiled, to sit in public assemblies, to study sciences and
arts, is contrary to nature, is an offense against purity, and tends to destroy her loveliness,--said
these inveterate croakers. Yet society recognized her influence and power, and believed she
had both rights and duties. Step by step, odious laws have been repealed, her right to her
own property has been in great measure secured, doors of usefulness have been opened before
her, her voice is welcomed from the platform, and her writings from the press. She visits the
sick and the prisoner, and pleads for the suffering, until hospitals and asylums are founded
in their behalf. She soothes the sorrows of the aged, takes the hand of the orphan to lead
him in paths of safety, and in the tumult of war ministers to the wounded and dying.

Amidst her general activity, many questions arise as to what further avenues of usefulness
may properly open. How far may she engage in business, and in what branches? what is her proper
work in the Church, and to what extent may she perform public religious services? is she properly
a citizen, and what privileges or rights should she enjoy?--are inquiries which are considered
and discussed. The greatest interest is at present excited by the question, ""Should women have
the ballot?"" and both in this country and in England it has able advocates and strong opponents.

It can not be denied that the answer of the large majority is in the negative, and that in
many instances this answer comes in the form of the laugh of ridicule or in the sneer of contempt.
Such is the fate of all incipient efforts for reformation; but where a cause is intrinsically
just, it can survive and triumph.

Without entering into the general discussion, two points may be briefly noted. First, this
question is considered only in Christian lands. It is not even heard of elsewhere. It is mooted
only in countries where the Bible is placed in the hands of the common people. It is strong
only where free institutions have been established, and where liberal ideas have prevailed.
It is the outgrowth of Bible freedom. Secondly, many of its opponents are persons of strong
intellect, of broad views, of great benevolence, and of unquestioned piety. Yet in the opposition
we find also all, or nearly all, of the most ignorant classes of society. We find also in the
opposition, with very few exceptions, the entire class of venders of intoxicating drinks, drunkards,
gamblers, and other notoriously vicious characters. Is there any reason for such an aggregation?
On the other hand, the friends of the measure, though fewer in number, are generally found
among the intelligent and religious members of the community. It is true that a few of those
who desired to be recognized as leaders of the movement are known as free-thinkers or infidels;
and a still smaller number have been advocates of free-love and other loathsome vagaries. The
opponents of the cause have skillfully presented their names as representatives of the idea,
and have thus cast such odium upon it that many timid persons, dreading even an apparent association
with them, have feared to express their own convictions. These odious parties, however, are
very few in number, and their influence is constantly diminishing. There can be no question
that four-fifths of the friends of female suffrage are to-day active members of various Christian
Churches; and of them no small number are ministers distinguished for their learning, benevolence,
and piety.

The signs of the times indicate a determined struggle between temperance and intemperance.
The use of intoxicating liquors is the source of nine-tenths of all the dark and terrible crimes
that disgrace humanity. It whets the assassin's dagger, and pours poison into the cup of the
suicide. It beggars the laborer, breaks the heart of the anguished wife, and starves the helpless
children. It fills jails and penitentiaries with victims, and hospitals and asylums with the
injured and hopelessly wrecked. It fastens on society an army of police to be supported, and
it oppresses the land with taxes. The money amassed by the venders buys our legislators, corrupts
our judges and governors, and controls our political parties. Who shall stay its ravages, or
curtail its power?

My conviction is, and for years has been, that the only hope is in giving the ballot to women.
True, some women love strong drink, and some are vile; yet the vast majority are utterly opposed
to intemperance. None so well as the drunkard's wife knows the terrible evil, or so keenly
feels its pangs. Could the mother, who bows her head in sorrow as she beholds her loved boy
hastening to ruin; the wife, whose once affectionate husband has been transformed into a demon;
the daughter, whose cheek has been mantled with shame at her father's fall, and who has suffered
the bitterness of blasted hopes and of dismal poverty,--could they have the ballot, how quickly
would the rum-shops be closed, and our youth be preserved from multi-fold temptations! What
other triumph could compare with this?

With this conviction, I hail with pleasure this volume from the pen of Dr. Webster. It discusses
an important question calmly, clearly, forcibly. I may not agree with all of his positions,
or with some of his Biblical criticisms, yet I believe the work possesses much merit, will
lead to serious thoughtfulness, and be productive of good.

I also rejoice that the enterprising publishers whose names appear on the imprint have added
this volume to their catalogue, and have thus given the influence of their names, and their
widely extended means of circulation, to a cause so intimately connected with the interests
of humanity. The Church, in its various denominations, and by its varied agencies, must ever
be, as it ever has been, the leader and the guide in great moral movements.

WOMAN MAN'S EQUAL.

CHAPTER I.

Natural Rights.

In the discussion of the question of woman's equality with man, I purpose to prove from the
Bible, as I believe I can, that at the creation there was neither superiority nor inferiority
ordained between Adam and Eve; and that the partial distinctions which have for ages existed,
and which still exist, are of man's invention; and may, therefore with propriety, be examined,
and, where found unfair or oppressive, may be justly condemned.

I hope also to be able to establish the fact, from history, that in every age, whenever an
opportunity has afforded itself, women have proved themselves to be fully men's equals in intellectual
capacity, in morality, industry, and religion; and that, in matters of government, they have
proved themselves to be as wise and judicious rulers as any of the opposite sex, under the
same, or similar, circumstances. That the instances in which women have been called to places
of power and responsibility in the State are comparatively rare, is not to be attributed to
natural incapacity or mental inferiority, but to the fact of the persistent efforts made by
men to keep them as much as possible in the background; that in many instances women have broken
the fetters of oppression and prejudice by which they were bound, and have ascended the hill
of fame in advance of their male opponents. If, then, women have in other and darker ages over-leaped
the formidable barriers placed in their way, and thus benefited their respective nations, and
sometimes the world, by their intrepidity, why should obstructions be placed in their path
now, in this day of professed light and progress? Freedom, improvement, and righteousness ought
to be the watchwords of the nations.

After enduring years of ridicule and contempt, the advocates of women's rights begin to see
some slight indications that their labors have not been altogether futile. Both in England
and America the movement is now making considerable progress. Persons of wealth, of high position
in the social scale, and of sound education, have become its warm friends and advocates; but,
so hard is it to remove old-time prejudice, it is probable that many years may yet elapse before
women will be allowed to enjoy equal rights and privileges with men.

All great reforms, whether European or American, are of slow growth, and are usually denounced
as running counter to Scripture and common sense; as witness the discussions on the disestablishment
of the Irish Church in Britain, and on the abolition of slavery in the United States; both
of which reforms were fiercely assailed as contrary to the Word of God and reason, and declared
to be in fact the offspring of infidelity. But, like these two great reforms, when movements
of vital importance are once inaugurated, their arriving at perfection is but a matter of time.
Right is almost always sure to prevail in the end.

The claiming for women equality with men, not only in mental capacity, but in civil and ecclesiastical
rights, may shock the preconceived opinions of many persons, and will probably subject the
individual advancing such views to the charge of fanaticism and false teaching; yet we conceive
the claim to be consistent with reason, justice, and the Word of God; and its full recognition
to be of vital importance to the entire race of mankind. In the discussion of this question,
the object will not be to flatter women, or to give offense to men; but simply to present the
requirements of impartial justice with regard to a portion of the human race, who, because
of their sex, have for centuries been held in a position little, if any, better than that of
slaves; and who, up to the present time, are deprived of their natural rights and privileges
by the laws of our own and other countries, professedly civilized, enlightened, and Christian.
While, therefore, the injustice suffered, both in the past and the present, by women, will
be briefly presented in the following pages, there is still no wish to deprive the ""lords of
creation"" of any really God-appointed privilege. But should we happen to come in contact with
the selfishness and the usurped prerogatives of men, we will not hesitate to expose what we
conceive to be grievous wrongs, because of their antiquity.

There is no human tie so sacred as that of marriage; and yet there is no covenant so generally
violated in some way or other by many of the contracting parties. The alliance, it is true,
may be continued, and even observed, so far as the letter is concerned. But what of the spirit?
When once true confidence is lost, the sublime and exalted character of the relation is destroyed.
There is no longer any genuine affection, or real union of heart, between the parties. Nothing
will destroy mutual confidence between two parties sooner than an arrogant assumption by one
of them of fancied superiority over the other. Self-respect is an inherent principle in human
nature. The mind of prince and peasant is alike actuated by it, and by an instinctive desire
for freedom and independence of action, for the advantages of civil and religious liberty,
and for the exercise of individual rights; and this instinctive desire is no less strong in
the hearts of women than of men. It is impossible for a woman of proper discernment, and of
refined taste and liberal education, to consider herself, simply because of her sex, inferior
to her own male relatives, or indeed to any one of the opposite sex, of the same intellectual
powers, literary attainments, and position in society. Nothing but the influence of a misdirected
or perverted education, or the most extreme degradation and ignorance, can in any one induce
the belief that woman is the inferior of man, merely because she is a woman.

No business firm could remain together in harmony for a single day, if it were understood that
one of the partners assumed the position that he was superior to the other, who, prior to entering
into the partnership, had been received in the same social circles, and who had brought into
the business an equal proportion of funds and of business talent. And doubly preposterous would
the assumption be, if it were based on the fact that the assumer was the larger or physically
stronger man; and, because possessed of more of the animal nature than his partner, it therefore
became his right to dictate to and control the other.

Such an assumption as this is no more absurd, nor is the reasoning upon which it is based more
illogical, than that which asserts that woman, because she is a woman, is therefore an inferior,
to be ruled at the discretion of her husband or sons in her own home; and that she ought to
be contented to be considered such, and to be so treated by her own nation and in her own family.
The carrying out of such an idea is more than absurd. It is monstrous. It is an imposition
that has only been tolerated because the exactions are not in every case so bad as the system
is capable of enforcing; and it is one from which every advocate of Christian liberty, to be
consistent with his profession, should withdraw both countenance and toleration.

The history of woman's wrongs has for ages been written in tears, often with her life-blood;
and yet the volume has, in most instances, been concealed in her own bosom, notwithstanding
its fearful weight. But if, at any time, as sometimes happens, unable to keep it hidden longer,
she unfolds the pages of her grief to others, what an outcry is raised against her! The oppressed
Italian peasant, the Russian serf, the Spanish or American black, all, if they are only of
the male sex, may make their wrongs public, may even resist oppression to the death, and be
applauded for so doing. But let a woman speak so that she can be heard, no matter how great
the outrages from which she has suffered, let her couch her timid complaint in ever such delicate
language, and what a storm of invective is hurled at her! The very act of complaining is declared--by
the advocates of her inferiority--to be in itself unwifely, indecent. ""A woman's voice has
no business to be heard outside of her own house; nor there, if her lord decrees otherwise,""
say they. It is asserted that she has been induced to give publicity to her sorrows--indeed,
has occasioned them--by peevishness or imprudence, or by something worse; and thus, by an,
unfair, sometimes an altogether false, issue being raised, the unhappy victim not merely of
oppression, but of downright brutality, is shut off from justly merited sympathy. And women,
too, who are more fortunately situated, in possessing somewhat kinder husbands, or in being
possessed by them, shaping their views according to those entertained by the sterner sex, unite
with them in the condemnation of a sorrow-stricken sister; and, instead of making her burden
lighter, contribute to increasing its weight. Such women having never felt the iron pierce
their own souls, can not realize the woes of those in whose bosoms the barb is rankling at
every pulsation, and they weakly fancy that the sorrows of those suffering ones are but the
inventions of an ill-ordered mind, or, at most, that the picture has been overdrawn.

Unkind men are not the only class, however, who assert the inferiority of the gentler sex.
If they were, they might be disposed of in a very summary manner. There is another class not
less dangerous, not less tyrannical or less arrogant, though somewhat more plausible. These
speak, when occasion suits, quite eloquently, often with indecorous flippancy, of the ""great
influence which the ladies are capable of exerting upon society;"" and for the qualified good
which the orators graciously concede that women have accomplished, or may be capable of accomplishing,
they bespatter them with a sort of sneering praise that is absolutely insulting to a woman
of common sense. This style of fulsome flattery, with some degree of soft attention, graciously
bestowed upon women, these men deem adequate compensation for all the indignities put upon
their so-called inferiors. With what supreme contempt, therefore, must every right-minded woman
listen to such harangues, or read them when in print!

Learned orators and divines and grave professors may, indeed sometimes do, soar away almost
to the seventh heaven while recounting the heroic or generous actions of women in past ages.
Admiring audiences are told that ""gentle women are the ministering angels, sent by the wisdom
of God to be the comforters of mankind upon earth, as the beloved of our hearths and homes;
that the world, without the gentle hand of woman to alleviate our sorrows, would be a dark
and dreary solitude swept by the whirlwinds of despair."" The delighted listeners are borne
away on the wings of fancy--alas! it is only fancy--till, in imagination, it would appear that
woman had escaped from her worse than Egyptian bondage, had crossed, without trouble, the Red
Sea, passed the dreadful wilderness, moved out from the plains of Moab, and, by some peculiar
magic of her own, had been deftly wafted over Jordan into the promised land; that already she
had gloried in the tumbling-down of the walls of Jericho, and had enjoyed the triumph of having
the delegation of Gibeonites coming, in their old garments, to seek an alliance with her as
the chosen of the Lord.

But let a woman allured by such an oration ask a right, and how soon the strain is changed!
Let her ask to be placed on an equality with man in regard to the holding of property, or to
civil or ecclesiastical rights, or authority or position; let the daughters ask equal rights
and privileges with sons; let them request admission into the same colleges and universities
with their brothers, so that they may compete with them for the honors and degrees conferred
in such institutions,--and what then? The flowery oratory is all gone. The ""angels,"" the ""heroic,
brave, and virtuous women,"" have suddenly become agitators whose conduct is unseemly. They
""are ambitious, indelicate, not to say immodest, bold-faced females""--whether of the human
or some other race we are not told.

Forgetting, apparently, that the Creator's universal law is liberty of thought and freedom
of action, coupled with a strict responsibility for the use of both, those who are opposed
to women exercising or enjoying equal rights with men, contend, as an excuse for their opposition,
that some of the women engaged in the present reform movement are extravagant in their demands,
and abuse the privileges they already possess. Precisely the same thing was said of the slaves
in the South. Indeed, the same argument, variously worded, has been used by oppressors in all
ages. ""Ye are idle, ye are idle,"" is a very old cry.

But, admitting that some women are injudicious and occasionally one is irreverent, are not
men, in advocating their peculiar views on politics, the same, only in much larger proportion?
Are they, therefore, deprived of the franchise or other privileges? If men were obliged to
come to such a standard as they lay down for women, they would consider the measure meted out
to them a very hard one. Still, if it is a just and fair way of dealing with woman's suffrage
and other questions of importance, it is an equally just and fair way to deal with men concerning
their right to exercise the franchise.

But, though deprived of the civil and ecclesiastical privileges accorded to their sons and
brothers, women are yet held equally accountable with them for any infraction of these same
civil and ecclesiastical laws. Not supposed to have sufficient mental capacity to understand
what a law really means, she is yet, if she violates that law, punished for such violation.
And, in the face of all this, it is sneeringly asked, ""What can reasonable women want more
than they already have?"" The answer is simple: Equal rights and privileges with men.

And it is to be hoped, for the honor of Christianity and civilization, that these will soon
be accorded.

Very much has been accomplished in several of the States of the Republic, in regard to giving
women a proper position in civil and educational matters, but much still remains to be done;
and just now it would seem doubtful which country will first accord the suffrage to them--England
or the United States. Eminent statesmen in both of these countries are moving in the matter.

CHAPTER II.

Woman in Antiquity.

In the preceding chapter it is mentioned that the intention is to present to the reader, in
as condensed a form as possible, some of the indignities put upon women, both in the past and
the present, so that the reader may be able to form a candid judgment on the subject of woman's
rights and woman's wrongs. We will, therefore, first consider the condition of the women of
antiquity, and of those in heathen and Mohammedan lands; and, afterward, her position in professedly
civilized and Christian countries.

After the dispersion of mankind at Babel, we behold, through the mists of the surrounding gloom,
the various tribes into which the race had by that event become divided, subsisting at first
by the spontaneous fruits of the earth, and by the chase. Then they became herdsmen, tillers
of the soil, and traffickers, varying these occupations by predatory warfare. They are all
astir, passing to and fro through the wide extent of the regions as yet inhabited. History,
so far as it deals with the earlier portion of this period, necessarily derives its material
from traditionary legends, more or less credible, as the case may be. These recount the marvelous
exploits--not unfrequently manifestly fabulous--of their rude heroes; their deeds of might,
their noble enterprises, their indomitable courage, their persistent activity, and often their
deeds of most revolting cruelty.

Of the women of this period we obtain but slight glimpses, but sufficient to show that, in
their domestic arrangements, the ancients early acted upon the principle, that ""might makes
right."" Muscle appears to have been at a premium during these eras.

Later, the nations are found still engaged in war, as if each esteemed the slaughtering of
its neighbors the grandest and noblest of human achievements; but their equipments indicate
that, meanwhile, manufactures have been making some advancement. Warriors present a more formidable
appearance than did those of former ages. They are clad in armor, and guard themselves with
breastplates and with shields. Their glittering swords and spears, their battle-axes and their
bows, are grasped in hands only too eager to use them; and the combatants press proudly on
toward the scene of conflict; while others, equally intrepid, but less military in their tastes,
still employ themselves in the chase; and the more indolent pursue pleasures of a less exciting
character.

But where, meanwhile, are the counterparts of these--the wives, sisters, and daughters of these
grim warriors and sturdy huntsmen, or of these dreaming idlers? In existence they certainly
are; but they exist only to drudge and suffer. While their masters are employing or non-employing
themselves, according to the bent of their inclination, they are cultivating the fields or
watering and herding the flocks, bearing heavy burdens, carrying the luggage of their husbands
to facilitate progress on the war-path; or at home rearing up children, who rarely rise up
to call them blessed; or they are waiting, in submissive obedience, at the feet of their reclining
lords, to be petted and caressed or cursed and kicked, as passion or caprice may dictate--subjected
alike to neglect, contempt, and abuse. Exceptions to this general rule doubtless occurred occasionally;
for irresponsible power does not of necessity convert every man into an unfeeling tyrant, just
as under other systems of slavery, some were fortunate enough to fall into the hands of kind,
considerate owners, whose hearts they inspired with love and tenderness; but neither bound
wife nor bond slave was treated with kindness, respect, or common justice, because their inherent
right to be so treated was recognized. It mattered little to the women of this period whether
they were held as wives or concubines; their actual condition was that of slavery.

In none of the countries of antiquity had women more liberty than in Egypt; and yet what was
her real condition there? Alexander remarked, it is true, that though ""the women promised obedience,
men often yielded it;"" and, in many instances, it is equally true that the laws respecting
women were immeasurably in advance of those of neighboring nations; as, for instance: Each
wife had entire control of her own house. Among the princes nearest the throne, women might
take their places, and even reign as sovereigns (a regency was frequently committed to their
care); or they might rule as joint sovereigns with another party; and as Isis took rank above
Osiris, so in such a case the woman might take rank above the man.[A]

But notwithstanding this advance beyond other nations, they were still spoken of, and in many
instances not only treated as inferiors, but held in hopeless bondage.

Among the Greeks, the wife was at times permitted to take part in public assemblies, but never
as the equal of her husband. She neither went with him to dinner, when he dined out, nor sat
at table with those whom he invited to his house. Aristotle held that ""the relation of men
to women is that of governor to a subject."" Plato says: ""A woman's virtue may be summed up
in a few words: for she has only to manage the house well, keeping what there is in it, and
obeying her husband."" Again, in further proof of the low estimation in which he held women,
he says: ""Of the men that were born, such as are timid and have passed through life unjustly
are, we suppose, changed into women in their second generation."" Plutarch tells us that women
""were compelled to go barefoot, in order to induce them to keep at home.""

The Spartan women were better off than their neighbors; and, in consequence, we get glimpses
of a higher type of womanhood. The Spartan mother has furnished a theme for the pen of every
ancient Greek historian. Under the Lycurgean system, women were considered ""as a part of the
State,"" and not simply household articles belonging to their husbands--chattels to be disposed
of according to the supreme pleasure of their masters. Free women were trained for the service
of the State with scarcely less severity than men. Lycurgus remarks: ""Female slaves are good
enough to sit at home, weaving and spinning; but who can expect a splendid offspring--the appropriate
mission and duty of free Spartan women toward their country--from mothers brought up in such
occupations?"" But though, like the Egyptian women, and indeed in advance of them, the Spartan
women were treated with, for the times, a marked degree of attention and respect, still, even
in Sparta, there were laws in force by which women suffered grievous injustice. With all the
apparent freedom accorded to them, fathers claimed and exercised the right of disposing of
their daughters in marriage to suit their own views or interests. Though free-born, a girl
had no choice, if her father willed it so, in the selection of her husband; and husbands might,
if they wished, dispose of their wives by will, at death, as they would of any other piece
of property. Though in a measure free, because she was a woman, she was still a slave.

Among the other infringements of the rights of women, and one of the most barbarous, common
to the heathen, both ancient and modern, and to the Mohammedans, is early betrothal. In fact,
the system of betrothal prevailed to a very great extent among the very earliest nations of
which history furnishes any account, the laws affecting it being only slightly modified to
suit the circumstances of the various tribes by which it was adopted. The main feature was
still the same--the girl had no choice; there was nothing for her but submission.

The lot of woman in China has, from time immemorial, been a hard one. Says a writer in the
Westminster Review for October, 1855: ""Of all nations, the Chinese carry out the system of
early betrothal most completely; parents in China not only bargain for the marriage of their
children during their infancy, but while they are yet unborn. If, when a daughter is betrothed
during infancy, the contract should not assume the form of actual sale, it is nevertheless
usual for the bridegroom, at the time he acquires possession of the bride, to pay into the
hands of her father a sum considered equivalent to the current value of a wife."" Immortality
is denied to woman by them. A Christian, intent on the evangelization of the Chinese, spoke
to one regarding the salvation of their women. ""Women,"" replied the Chinaman; ""women have no
souls. You can't make Christians of them."" Few persons born in civilized lands, unless brought
into immediate contact with the heathen, can have any idea of the wretched condition of their
women, even at this day. Kept in a state of abject bondage, they are compelled to serve with
rigor. Controlled as though they were possessed of less intelligence than male children of
tender years, it might yet be supposed, from the burdens laid upon them, that they were possessed
of far superior strength, physically, than men. In some countries--not all of them heathen
or Mohammedan either--the amount of labor imposed upon women of the lower orders in society
would task the strength of beasts of burden. The only exercise of reason allowed among such,
is a sort of instinct which will enable them to perform all kinds of drudgery, and to act with
scrupulous fidelity to their unkind, very often brutal and faithless, husbands--task-masters
would be the better name. Of women under such rule, it may truly be said, the grave is their
best, their only friend.

Among the Arabs, prior to Mohammed, the women were in a wretchedly debased condition, which
has been but slightly improved by the rules of the Koran. By its sanction, wives were bought
by their husbands, though it was asserted that it was not lawful for men to exchange their
wives. The price paid by Mohammed for his wives, of which he had nine, varied, according to
their rank and beauty, from one to one hundred dollars each. The common people procured theirs
at a cheaper rate. Specific directions are given, too, for the proper government of women.
""Those wives,"" says Mohammed, ""whose perverseness ye may be apprehensive of, rebuke, and remove
them into separate apartments, and chastise them.""[B] When such precepts as these were laid
down in the Koran, which was considered a direct revelation from God, it is not surprising
that the severest punishment was inflicted on women who attempted to exercise any control over
themselves or their households. The will of the proud, insolent Arab was supreme, whether his
demands were reasonable or otherwise; having bought his wives cheap, he might maltreat or divorce
them at pleasure. Like the Chinese, the Mohammedan women are denied the hope of immortality.
""Earthly women, when they die, cease to have any existence; but men, if faithful to Mohammed,
are to enter paradise, and be associated with a new race of transcendently beautiful female
beings."" ""The glories of eternity,"" says the Koran, ""will be eclipsed by the resplendent 'women
of paradise,' created 'not of clay, as mortal women are, but of pure musk, and free from all
natural impurities, defects, and inconveniencies incident to the sex; ... secluded from public
view in pavilions of hollow pearl.'""[C]

A distinguished European writer observes: ""The Hindoos seem to have legislated with the greatest
care and detail concerning women. Yet by no people, legally speaking, is her individuality
more entirely ignored; and in no country is the slavery in which she lives, at once so systematic,
refined, and complete as it is in India, where the lawgiver and the priest are one. The oppressive
custom of life-long guardianship is expressly ordained. By a girl, or by a woman advanced in
years, nothing must be done, even in her own dwelling-place, according to her mere pleasure.
In childhood must a female be dependent on her father, in youth on her husband; her lord being
dead, on her sons; if she have no sons, on the near kinsman of her husband; if he left no kinsman,
on those of her father; if she have no parental kinsman, on the sovereign. A woman must never
seek independence.""[D] Not permitted to have any discretionary power over her own actions at
any period of her life, but held in every respect subject to the will of her husband, or some
other male guardian, she is nevertheless to be unswervingly faithful to her lord while he lives;
and no matter how cruelly he may have treated her, she is loaded with contumely, reproach,
and scorn, if she refuses to lay herself upon the funeral pile, and in the flames pass into
another state of being, to do honor to him who through life had been an unrelenting tyrant.
Knowing the obloquy which attaches itself to the widow who recoils from such a fearful death-bed,
and ignorant, too, of the ""better way,"" the unfortunate creature generally yields to the pressure
brought to bear upon her, and terminates a miserable life by an awful death; her horrid shrieks,
while burning, mingling with the clamor of sounds raised to drown them by the heartless throng
of spectators, and yet sometimes rising with distressing distinctness above them. When the
wife of a Hindoo dies, does he sacrifice himself upon a funeral pile, in order to honor her
in another state of existence? By no means. His precious body can not be committed to the flames;
they are too hot for his manly courage. He burns her corpse with what are termed appropriate
offerings; and, if so disposed, adds a new wife to his household, thus soothing his sorrow.

In Australia, the practice of early betrothal is nearly universal among the natives; men of
distinction having several wives at the same time, and these varying in age from the little
child to the woman of mature years. But while polygamy prevails to a fearful extent among the
men of the wealthier class, many of the men of the humbler ranks remain unmarried, because
they are unable to raise the purchase-money which secures them their domestic drudge. In the
western part of Australia, especially before the benefits of civilization began to be felt
in the island, it was the practice to betroth the daughters to some individual, immediately
upon their birth; and should the man, or male child to whom the infant girl was betrothed,
die before she arrived at maturity, she became the property of the heirs of her betrothed husband,
though she might never have seen either this reputed husband, or the person who, as his representative,
claimed her as his wife by virtue of the betrothal. In New Zealand, if the spouse of a female
child dies before she is taken to his home, she is never allowed to marry any one else. By
this custom young children become the widows of little boys or old men, according to the whims
of their fathers. Another horrible practice of the Australians is, the exchange of daughters
by their fathers. This is very common among the chiefs, the exchange being made with as little
concern as jockeys exchange their horses. It is stated that the poorer men sometimes supplied
themselves with wives after the manner of the Romans in the case of the Sabine Rape; and that
when victorious in war, the women and girls captured were taken as wives, while the male prisoners
were put to death. But where they were able to afford it, they preferred the betrothal system,
as giving them more consequence. Not only in Australia, but in the other countries where early
betrothal was practiced, if, when a boy grew up, he formed a dislike to his betrothed, or for
some other whim desired to cast her off, he was at liberty to do so, but no such privilege
was granted the girl. Then, as now in civilized nations, those making the laws were careful
to make them all to their own advantage.

In the foundation of some of the nations of antiquity, men were frequently gathered, from almost
every quarter of the then known globe, to the particular spot that seemed best suited for the
purposes of self-aggrandizement; and, in the rude horde thus congregated together, there was
necessarily an undue preponderance of the male element. In some instances, not one woman was
to be found in such a community. The tribes more immediately contiguous to these settlements,
if such they might be called, were not inclined to enter into friendly relations with them,
and therefore they were unable to supply themselves with wives in the usual manner; consequently,
they had recourse to other means. Sometimes women were procured by stratagem; sometimes bands
of marauders sallied forth, and stole, or in some other equally exceptionable way took possession
of, the women of the neighboring or of hostile tribes.

Ordinarily, the poor victims submitted to their fate with the best grace they might; but if
one thus taken by force attempted to make her escape from him who claimed her as his wife,
and was unfortunate enough to be retaken, a spear, or some similar weapon, was thrust through
the fleshy portion of one of her limbs, effectually disabling her from making another attempt
of the kind; and not unfrequently the combined bodily pain and mental anguish terminated in
death--a happy release.

In process of time, however, the various tribes began to regard each other with less aversion
than formerly; and it became safer and more profitable to purchase women, on the same principle
that any other kind of merchandise was bought. Prices were regulated according to the supply
in the market and the beauty or the muscular strength of the hapless creatures exposed for
sale. Fathers sold or exchanged their daughters, brothers their sisters, without the slightest
shame or remorse. Among the Tambanks, in exchanging the women for stock, a woman, full-grown
and of ordinary strength, was considered equal in value to two cows or one ox.

As the settlements became more permanent, assuming by degrees the character of established
nations, and the centers of enterprise grew into populous cities, the barter and exchange traffic
naturally declined; but in its place were established regular markets for the sale of female
slaves. Civilization was beginning to make some slight progress; and fathers began to entertain
doubts regarding the propriety of selling their own flesh and blood, though they did not hesitate
to buy their wives.

The slaves who were exposed in the marketplaces, therefore, were generally the overplus not
desired in the harems of those who had captured them in war; and as the most beautiful brought
the highest market-price, the public exhibitions of the poor unfortunates drew thither crowds
of gaping people--some merely curious, some intent on business. Even in more modern days, the
slave-markets of the East, and in the Southern States of the American Republic, have attracted
crowds of spectators--some to condemn the horrible practice, some to compassionate the unhappy
victims, but most to engage in the monstrous traffic.

It is not necessary to review further, in detail, the condition of women in the various nations
as they sprang into existence, or through the successive periods of their history to the commencement
of the Christian era. Various causes brought about a partial liberty for women, in both the
Jewish and Roman nations, prior to the birth of Christ; but for those of other lands the blackness
of darkness still remained. It was but a partial liberty, it is true, even for the Hebrew or
Roman women, but their condition was much improved. Concessions had been made slowly. They
had come in shreds, and had not amounted to much in ameliorating their situation when they
came; but slight as were the privileges yielded, they were yet indications of the dawning of
a brighter day for Eve's poor daughters.

The reformations effected were like wresting prey from the mighty. And how could it be otherwise,
with selfishness and love of power, sustained by unjust and one-sided laws, arrayed against
merely natural rights--not demanded, scarcely even asserted--and those to whom these rights
belonged excluded from every position where they might hope to do either the one or the other
successfully? The law of divorce was still common; and, like every thing else where the sexes
were concerned, all the advantages were on the side of the oppressor, man.

The laws of the Romans, though according a greater degree of freedom to woman than had hitherto
been granted, were still not only imperfect, but were not properly carried out, in many instances,
where it suited venal judges to side with wealthy libertines who might have it in their power
to bestow a favor. Professedly, each Roman had but one wife; but divorces, on most frivolous
pretexts, were of frequent occurrence, granted in favor of one who wished to gratify his licentious
passions without rebuke. Slavery was yet in force; and it gave ample opportunity for the practice
of this injustice, even upon the free-born Roman woman. Every true Roman held his wife's or
his daughter's honor sacred, and would resent to the death any attempt to violate it; but,
by the connivance of corrupt officials, the protection of an upright father was rendered of
no avail, by a perjurer being found who would appear before the proper tribunal and swear the
maid or woman in question to be his slave. The decision once given in the libertine's favor,
there was no longer hope for her--she was lost forever.

Not always, however, would Roman freemen tamely brook open injustice, much less shame, without
revenging it, though they died in doing so. The case of Appius--who was himself both the libertine
and judge--is in point. Having set his licentious eyes upon the beautiful Virginia--daughter
of Virginius, a centurion of the army--and having in vain sought to obtain possession of her
person by tampering with the matron who conveyed her to and from her school, he induced an
equally licentious individual, one Claudius, to claim her as his slave, and bring the matter
before himself for decision. In vain the anguished father asserted that Virginia was his child.
With an air of apparent impartiality, Appius decreed that she belonged to Claudius, who thereupon
proceeded to remove her. The father begged that they might at least be allowed to take leave
of each other, which request was granted, on condition of their doing so in the presence of
the oppressor. Drawing the girl, now nearly dead from fright, toward himself, and also toward
the shambles, adjoining which they were, he snatched thence a knife, and, before any suspected
his intention, stabbed her to the heart, crying, ""This alone can preserve your honor and your
freedom.""[E]

The fearful deed of the centurion is appalling; but remember his ideas of right and wrong were
veiled in pagan darkness. He took the life of his child to save her from a fate incomparably
worse than that of death; and made his name historic by doing so. Thousands of fathers have
found their efforts to protect the innocence of their daughters as unavailing as did the unhappy
Virginius, unless, like him, they shortened life. The victims, too, are as little free-will
agents in the matter as Virginia would have been; and many thousands of daughters have fallen,
not by their father's hand to save their honor, but by cruel deception, and died to all that
was beautiful or pure on earth, and to every hope of heaven.

And while the woman who has sinned, and fallen through that sin, is pitied by few, despised
by nearly all, and but little effort made to win her back to the path of purity, how is the
companion of her sin treated? He, the seducer--often the grossest of deceivers, the instigator
of the crime--because he is a man, is countenanced by the many, his conduct palliated, and
himself received as an honored guest, even in the highest circles of society. The law of God
makes no distinction between the male violator of His holy law and the female violator of the
same; but man, arrogating to himself superior wisdom, makes a very marked one.

No wonder, then, that women groan because of their bondage.

CHAPTER III.

Later Estimate of Woman.

In the discussion of the position occupied by women as wives, those only have been spoken of
who were betrothed in infancy, or were captured, stolen, or bought. These latter were, without
further ceremony, merely taken home to the abode of their future husband and lord. In the later
periods of antiquity, betrothal terminated in a marriage ceremony, the rite varying according
to the prevailing customs of each nation.

Opinions with regard to the qualifications which ought to be possessed by a woman to fit her
for marriage--which were, in fact, considered indispensable--were as various as the nations
or the rites; and, truth to tell, are about as conflicting now as they were centuries ago.
In all the ages, and in every country, one thing seemed to be agreed upon, however, and sedulously
kept in view; namely, woman's inferiority. Let her be free-born or a slave, to be married or
bought, she must still be a bondwoman--a creature subject to guardianship.

After men began to desire wives who were not altogether drudges, women began to be esteemed
in proportion to their beauty, not their wisdom or good judgment. A fine figure, delicate hands,
and handsome face, with fascinating manners, a graceful carriage, and such accomplishments
as were the fashion, quite regardless of the accomplishments of head or heart, were all that
were required by the class of men who could afford to keep such dainty wares. But love, inspired
by such attractions as these and nothing else, is ever fickle as the wind. When health declined
and beauty faded, the fire of passion, misnamed love, died out; and the hapless wife frequently
found herself deserted--if not openly, none the less shamefully--for a younger rival, whose
eye was brighter and whose cheek more plump. Then shrewd women began to study artifice. Deception
is wrong, without doubt; but before we too severely censure these women, let us remember how
deeply they were wronged, how great their temptations, how much they had at stake. In order
to retain any thing like a comfortable or respectable position in their husband's houses, the
waning beauties resorted to flattery and to the invention and skillful use of various articles
which would conceal the declension of beauty or artfully counterfeit it. The ways and means
by which attractiveness of face and figure might be enhanced, preserved, or simulated, became
the subject of serious study--something neither to be sneered at nor laughed at. The happiness
of a life-time often depended upon it. The sex, taught by a bitter experience, learned that
men, as a rule, were more easily influenced by blandishment and show than by good sense and
genuine worth, and, with a few exceptions, strove somewhat to better their condition by practicing
the lesson so learned. If, in the long run, women became frivolous, brainless, and heartless,
why was it?

There were, however, in all ages, exceptions. Women, yielding to the God-given yearning after
higher and better things than idle frivolities, and longing just as ardently for love and happiness
in their married homes, sought to work out life's problem differently, and went to work as
rational creatures. Breaking through or over the obstacles which debarred them from enjoying
or making use of the sources of information open to the opposite sex, they strove to cultivate
their minds and store them with useful knowledge, that they might indeed be helpmeets for their
husbands, and so not only win, but by true worth retain, their love.

Then those who had hitherto sneered at woman's incapacity for intellectual attainments, or
lectured her roundly for frivolity, heartlessness, and deception, sneered all the more at her
presumption in fancying her heart, or head either, required any other cultivation than man,
in his wisdom, saw fitting. Any thing at all likely to elevate woman to her proper place of
equality with her husband, must be put down at once and forever, if possible. But, notwithstanding
all the pains taken to place women in an inferior position, and keep them there, they have,
in many instances, despite the sneers and persecutions of the opposite sex, proved their aptitude
in acquiring knowledge; and, when placed in positions to call forth such powers, have manifested
a judicious tact in the government of nations or generalship of armies, quite equal to men,
with all their vaunted superiority. Nor did those women who thus distinguished themselves,
or those who in private life became proficients in the various branches of science or in music,
poetry or the languages, necessarily neglect their homes and families in consequence. Experience,
in our own times, proves exactly the reverse. Dereliction of duty with regard to home duties
results much more frequently from devotion to fashionable pleasures--considered quite allowable
and womanly--than from the pursuit of literature.

That marriage was designed by the Creator for the mutual benefit, help, and happiness of those
entering into that relation, there can be no doubt; but, through the selfishness of man--helped
on by the fact that, like the partner referred to previously, he was physically the stronger
of the two--the gracious purposes of the Creator were lost sight of, or ignored. And God suffered
it so to be, for the time, just as he did other forms of slavery and outcrying sins of various
kinds.

It has been said that the marriage ceremonies and festivals were as various as the several
nations in which they were performed. A description of a few of these may not be uninteresting.

Among the Jews, the period of betrothal having expired, the marriage was celebrated by a feast,
the bride being arrayed as magnificently as her circumstances would allow. If the contracting
parties were distinguished personages, the ceremony was frequently celebrated at night, the
bridal party, carrying their lamps or torches with them, going forth in procession to meet
and do honor to the bridegroom.

With the Romans, the consent of the father or guardian of the maiden having been obtained,
a sacrifice was prepared. ""The gall was carefully removed,"" and the propitiatory offering made
to the gods. To have been emblematical, the gall should have been presented to the bride. In
most cases, it fell to her lot. On the wedding-day the bridegroom, with his attendants, presented
himself at the place designated for the performance of the ceremony, where he was met by the
bride, gorgeously appareled, and her maids. Then, in presence of her father or guardian and
proper witnesses, the pair went through a formula of words as given them by the officiating
priest. On the completion of this part of the ceremony, the company partook of a cake made
of flour, salt, and water. This was the original ""bride-cake."" After night, the bride, accompanied
by her relatives and maids of honor, was escorted with due pomp to the residence of the bridegroom,
the door of which she found bound with strings, over which she was obliged to step. Having
effected an entrance, she received the keys of the house, and the bridegroom and herself again
repeated, after the priest, the formula which had been gone over earlier in the day. Then,
having touched fire and water, and sacrificed to the domestic gods, which were placed on the
table, the wedding festivities commenced, and were continued till midnight, when the guests
dispersed.

In India, the magnificence of the marriage-feast can scarcely be imagined, especially when
celebrated by torch-light procession.

In almost all the nations of antiquity, who had any marriage ceremony at all, a woman's wedding-day
was one of splendor and apparent honor, the only day in which any of her wishes were deferred
to during her whole lifetime. Light was soon lost in darkness--anticipated pleasure in disappointment,
degradation, and despair. The day of her death was the first day of her freedom.

CHAPTER IV.

The Sexes Equal at Creation.

From the arguments brought forward by the advocates of woman's inferiority, it might be inferred
that she was designed, from the very dawn of creation, for man's servant, not for his companion;
and, indeed, it is not only inferred by the great mass of mankind, but broadly asserted to
be the fact by very many who, from their knowledge of the history of creation, ought to know
better.

Those who have striven to establish this doctrine have contrived to bring the Scriptures to
their aid by wresting them to suit their own particular view of the question, and in this manner
have endeavored to silence any controversy respecting their dogma. The result has been--and
it is the legitimate result of such a pernicious course--that this wresting of the Scriptures,
and its having been allowed for a length of time to go unchallenged by the Christian world,
has produced scores of infidels, who, not having examined the Word of God critically for themselves,
have accepted as true expositions of the doctrines contained therein the statements of men,
apparently supported by isolated texts, separated from their contexts; and thus, having been
led to believe that the Scriptures sanctioned, if they did not enforce, manifest injustice,
they have repudiated the whole as unworthy of belief. A deplorable conclusion, truly! Then,
though responsible for this infidelity through their perversion of Scripture, these same writers,
or those of a kindred spirit, denounce every argument or movement in favor of the equal rights
and privileges of women as evil, and only evil, and necessarily evil, because among the advocates
of measures according these rights there are found some men and women who are skeptics.

But what say the Scriptures upon the subject? In the history of the creation, there given,
we search in vain for any evidence of the Divine appointment, at that time, of masculine domination.
As between the human pair, there is not here the slightest intimation given of the subjection
of the one to the other. The Great Infinite in wisdom, who created ""them,"" and who could not
be mistaken in their capacities, appears to have placed ""them"" on a perfect equality, committing
to them conjointly the dominion over the earth and all that it contained.

In the second chapter of Genesis we find a brief recapitulation of the events narrated in the
first, the sacred historian entering more fully into the creation of the woman. God, in his
wisdom, saw that Adam was not sufficient alone to sway the mighty scepter over the vast domain
about to be intrusted to him; therefore he created for him ""an helpmeet,"" and gave ""them"" a
joint authority over the rest of creation.

Thus it was in the beginning. But, in process of time, men, glorying in the physical strength
in which they excelled women, refused to recognize as its equivalent the peculiar qualities
and faculties possessed by women which were lacking in themselves. And overlooking the importance
of the duties which the mothers of mankind were discharging, they plumed themselves upon their
own prowess, and concluded that women and all else were made only to minister to their pleasures.
Reason and justice were obliged to succumb to the strong arm, and women were forced into a
subordinate position.

If the Creator, in the arrangements of his plans, designed that women should be inferior to
men in intellect and freedom of action, then, in regard to one-half of the human family, God
worked by the law of retrogression, producing Eve, an inferior, from Adam, a superior being;
which is clearly contrary to the law of progression, and contrary to the general plan of his
creation; and, if this be true, the laws of progression and retrogression were to alternate
perpetually. Is this supposition of inferiority in the case of woman consistent with what we
know of God's method of working, as given in the history of the creation? Let us recapitulate
the whole briefly, and see.

1. He created inanimate matter. 2. He brought vegetable life into existence. 3. The inhabitants
of the waters were created. 4. ""The cattle after their kind."" Here, then, we see that God created
man from a portion of inanimate earth; but that he produced the woman from a perfect portion
of the perfect man, plainly appears from the twenty-first and twenty-second verses of the second
chapter of Genesis, which, though quoted recently, necessarily come in, in this place. Did
Eve, then, because she was first in the transgression, forfeit her right of equality with Adam,
who just as flagrantly transgressed the Divine command; or was the penalty inflicted in consequence
of her disobedience another matter altogether?

Genesis iii, 16, is usually brought forward to prove that, if woman was not inferior before
the fall, she became so absolutely and unconditionally then. A disinterested reader--could
such be found--would scarcely so render it. Upon the latter clause of this verse, separating
it from all connection with the former part of the sentence, with which, however, it is connected
in the Sacred Word, is based the dogma of the continued, unchangeable curse of inferiority
of all the daughters of Eve, and their obligation to serve and implicitly obey their husbands.
And yet if a wife, in obedience to the command of her husband, violates the law, either of
God or man, she is the party held responsible. If she is not possessed of sufficient mental
capacity to judge for herself in all things, how can she know when she should obey or when
disobey? If implicit obedience is her duty, is there any justice, then, in punishing her for
obeying the order of him whom she is bound to obey? Those who construe this and other portions
of the Word of God to suit themselves, would protest loudly enough against the ""manifest injustice""
if it were meted out to them. But we know there is no unrighteousness with God. The Bible expressly
declares that ""God is no respecter of persons,"" and that ""his ways are true and righteous altogether.""

If then we examine this text (Gen. iii, 16) candidly, even taking the generally accepted translation,
and construe it with the same fairness with which we would construe a sentence the meaning
of which was not in dispute, the conclusion arrived at would be very different from what it
usually is; and it would be apparent that the words, ""And thy desire shall be to thy husband,
and he shall rule over thee,"" has reference to the subject of generation, of which the entire
passage treats. There are, however, some commentators who incline to the opinion that the words
""and he shall rule over thee,"" might with equal propriety be rendered, ""He shall have power
with thee."" We know that at this very time the promise of the Messiah--the seed that was to
bruise the serpent's head--was given to the woman. ""He,"" thy husband, ""shall have power with
thee,"" would not then be an inappropriate termination to the sentence relating to generation.
Raschi, a celebrated Hebrew writer and rabbi, who flourished in the twelfth century, supports
this reading, ""He shall have power with thee;"" but the majority of commentators and the Talmud
are against such a rendering. It is to be borne in mind, however, that the Talmud is not the
Pentateuch, and that learned and sincerely pious commentators have differed, and do so still,
as widely as the poles, upon passages quite as easily understood as the one now under discussion.
There is no more proof in this verse that a woman is bound to serve and obey her husband, in
the common acceptation of the term, than that a man is obligated to serve and obey his wife,
or worship her with his body--whatever that may mean--as he solemnly vows to do in certain
marriage services. The endowment with worldly goods and the worship promised, were perhaps
put in as an offset to the pledge of service and obedience. Certainly the man's vow to worship
his wife is no more inconsistent than is the woman's to obey implicitly; and her obedience,
if it is not implicit, is not obedience at all, but is merely acceding to the wishes of her
husband when they accord with her own judgment.

Infidels, in seeking to disparage the Word of God, quote this passage and kindred ones, and,
accepting the commonly received idea of their meaning, endeavor to subvert the faith of the
masses. With those who do not carefully examine the matter for themselves, they often succeed.
It has been asserted, too, by those who would wish the teachings of the Koran to take precedence
over those of the Bible, that the position accorded to women by the Mosaic law was quite as
degrading as that accorded to them by Mohammed; but a careful reading of the Scripture warrants
no such conclusion. Many matters are spoken of, both in the law and the prophets, as having
been practised and tolerated, and even rules given for their regulation, which were by no means
of Divine appointment. This distinction should always be carefully marked in regard to the
sacred text; and in addition to this it should be remembered that the Word of God is not responsible
for the erroneous opinions of mankind. When the Almighty placed human beings upon the earth,
he created one man and one woman, destining them to be the progenitors of the entire race,
thereby indicating that monogamy was of Divine appointment. But original purity was soon departed
from; lawless passion was allowed to mar the beautiful completeness and concord of the marriage
relation as instituted by God; and, in time, many even of those who were nominal worshipers
of the true God, fell into polygamy. The true idea and design of marriage, and the rights of
woman, with the respect due to her, was lost sight of, and the requirements of the Divine law
set at nought. Men became the slaves of their own lusts. God was not in all their thoughts.
Iniquity prevailed to such a frightful extent that ""it repented the Lord that he had made man
upon the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.""[I]

At this time of general apostasy, Noah--and, it would seem, he alone--was seen righteous before
God. Him, therefore, with his family, the Almighty preserved in the ark, when in his fierce
wrath he caused the deluge to sweep away the corrupt inhabitants from the face of the earth
they had polluted. Notwithstanding the wide-spread corruption of the times, it does not appear
that either Noah or his sons were polygamists. Certainly, if any one of them had been such
prior to the building of the ark, he was not permitted to bring his harem into it for protection
from the fearful storm. Only ""eight persons,"" we are informed, were preserved alive; namely,
Noah and his wife, with his three sons and their wives. Then, at what may be termed the second
starting-point of the human race, there was again an equal number of men and women upon the
earth; clearly pointing out that the design of the Almighty in this matter was the marriage
of one man with one woman. God made no provision for the marriage of either man or woman after
the obtaining of a divorce.

It might have been supposed that so fearful a display of the wrath of God would have made a
lasting impression upon the descendants of Noah; but as is the case with perverse mankind now,
so it was then; the lessons of the past were lost upon them. No very great period of time elapses
till we find the posterity of this good man, Noah, impiously and daringly conceiving the idea
of measuring strength with the Almighty by attempting to build a tower so high that it could
not possibly be overflowed should a subsequent deluge occur. The dispersion of mankind, and
the consequent division into tribes, or races, was the result of such presumption. The desperately
wicked heart of man began to devise new mischiefs, and revive old ones. Monogamy, the great
conservator of moral purity, was disregarded, and one corruption viler than another followed
in rapid succession. Before the calling of Abraham, mankind, as a whole, appear to have lapsed,
if not into absolute heathenism, at least into something very near it. The knowledge and worship
of the true God seems to have been retained only in isolated families, and even there to have
been but partially observed, being marred and dishonored by human inventions and substitutions.

That Abraham might be delivered from the pernicious example of his neighbors, and that his
mind might be prepared for the reception of the grand manifestations of the Divine character
which God designed to impart to him, he was commanded to break off all association with them;
and, the more completely to effect this, he was desired to leave his kindred and his country,
and become a stranger in a strange land. Yet somewhat of the contamination of early association
seems to have clung both to him and Sarah, as is evidenced in the matter of Hagar. In something
very like doubt of God's power to fulfill his own promise, Abraham yielded to Sarah's suggestion,
and thus was partially drawn into the evil current, though he does not appear to have been
a willful polygamist. It is asserted by Jonathan Ben Uzziel, the Jerusalem Targum, and other
learned authorities, that Hagar and Keturah are the same person; but if this be a mistake,
there is still no evidence that Abraham took Keturah till after the death of Sarah. Polygamists,
both in the Jewish nation and elsewhere, have not failed to plead Abraham's example in defense
of their conduct. Early association had somewhat obscured his moral perceptions of right and
wrong. Had he waited for the Divine command before carrying out Sarah's suggestion, no incident
in his life would have given countenance to the demoralizing practice. Isaac was a monogamist,
though Jacob, through the artifice of Laban, became a polygamist. That Laban's family were
tinctured with idolatry is unquestionable; and with idolatry came many other vices. When Jacob
with his household took his departure from Laban, Rachel stole certain images which were her
father's, the character of which was unmistakably indicated by Laban when he demanded, ""Wherefore
have ye stolen my gods?"" Yet such was the general apostasy of the times, that this family was
so much in advance of any other, that it was to it that Abraham was obliged to send, a generation
previous, for a suitable wife for the amiable and meditative Isaac. What wonder then that many
practices prevailed among the descendants of Jacob that were not in accordance with either
the will or the word of God!

Though plurality of wives was customary both before and after the giving of the Law, it was
by no means ordained by it. A man had no more right, in carrying out the designs of the Almighty,
to have two or more wives living at the same time, than a woman had to have two or more husbands
living at the same time. Wherever the Bible speaks of the duty of husbands to wives, or of
wives to husbands, the singular form is invariably used, as husband and wife. For instance,
when God brought the woman he had made to Adam, he (Adam) says: ""Therefore shall a man leave
his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife""--not wives--""and they shall be one
flesh."" And again, ""They twain shall be one flesh."" What God has directly commanded, and what
he merely suffers men to do without imposing insuperable restraints upon them, are two very
different things.

It is asserted that the Mosaic Law makes a very great and decidedly partial distinction between
men-servants and maid-servants, greatly to the disadvantage of the latter, particularly in
their release from servitude. These same texts--some of them, at least--have been quoted in
defense of African slavery. The term, selling a Jewish servant, in the Scripture, is simply
the same as binding out a child under English law. A Jewish father could only ""sell,"" or in
other words bind out, his daughter for six years, and that before she was of a suitable age
to be married.[J] At the expiration of six years her apprenticeship ceased, and the maid-servant
was free, unless she voluntarily perpetuated her own servitude.

There were two classes of servants among the Jews. The first, those who were taken from among
themselves; the second, those obtained of the strange nations by which they were surrounded,
or who were taken captive in battle. This second class of servants were called bondmen and
bondwomen. The former class were denominated servants. The practice authorized by law, regarding
those who were the lineal descendants of Abraham, placed men and women in the very same relation
to the master, who was bound to reward them alike when the period of service should terminate.
... And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee
and thine house, because he is well with thee; then thou shalt take an awl, and thrust it through
his ear into the door, and he shall be thy servant forever. And also unto thy maid-servant
thou shalt do likewise.""

Those who declare that the law of Moses makes a distinction in the matter of release from servitude,
between men-servants and maid-servants, to the disadvantage of the latter, in confirmation
of their assertion quote Exodus xxi, 7; but if they read also, in connection with it, the eighth,
ninth, tenth, and eleventh verses of the same chapter, a careful consideration of the entire
passage will, we think, clearly show that the reference therein contained is not to the ordinary
maid-servant, but to one whose master had betrothed her to himself, or to his son. In the case
of betrothal to himself, if the girl failed to please her master, he was not to return her
to her former position of a servant, but to let her be redeemed. He must not sell her, or otherwise
dispose of her services during the unexpired period of her servitude, because ""he had dealt
deceitfully with her."" In case of betrothal to his son, as in the other, she was not to be
reduced to her former rank as a menial, but to be treated in every respect as a daughter. Even
when the affection of the man to whom she was betrothed waned, he was to yield to her all the
rights and privileges which belonged to her as his wife; and, if any of these were withheld,
she was at liberty to go forth a free woman.

The circumstance of Jacob serving Laban fourteen years for Rachel, is by some deemed a parallel
case with the prevailing custom of purchasing wives among the people of the East; but the cases
are not at all similar. Jacob and Rachel had met at the well where she usually watered her
father's flock. He had introduced himself to the maiden, and won her regard, before he proposed
to her father for her, having spent a whole month in the house of Laban prior to his doing
so. There is no reason whatever to doubt that he had Rachel's full consent to the arrangement.
It was not Jacob's fault that, through the stratagem of Laban, he became the husband of Leah.
The plurality of wives in this instance was not so much the choice of Jacob as the fault of
the wily, semi-idolatrous Laban.

Shechem offered dowry to Jacob and his sons if they would consent to his taking Dinah to wife;
but it is evident he did so in order to conciliate the outraged brothers of the girl whom he
had so basely humbled, and whom he really desired to retain.

It is very clear, from the testimony of sacred history, that women, in the families of the
patriarchs, and in the Hebrew nation generally, for several generations after the delivery
of the Mosaic Law, occupied a position very much superior to those of the neighboring nations.
A woman taken captive in war, whom a Jew chose to marry, could not be sold by her husband,
should he afterward take a dislike to her so great that he might put her away. Even though
a heathen, she was permitted to go out free.

Boaz is said to have bought Ruth when he purchased the possession of Naomi; and this circumstance
is referred to by those who would bring the Bible into contempt, to prove that Ruth was bought
according to Jewish law, as though she were a chattel. The facts, as given in the sacred narrative,
do not, however, warrant any such interpretation.

Elimelech, with his wife and two sons, Mahlon and Chilion, left Bethlehem-Judah in consequence
of a severe famine, and removed to Moab. At the time of their emigration, they were obliged
to leave all their possessions, not portable, behind them; and were in consequence in straitened
circumstances. While in Moab, both his sons married Moabitish women; and, in process of time,
Elimelech and his sons all three died, leaving their respective widows destitute. Under these
circumstances, the famine being now over in Judah, Naomi determined to return thither, and
advised her daughters-in-law to return each to the house of her father.

Naomi, having such proof of her attachment to her, expostulated with her no further; and, disconsolate
and weary, the poor women made their way to Naomi's old home. During the absence of the family,
the parcel of land which had been possessed by Elimelech had passed into the hands of strangers.
Naomi naturally desired that it might be redeemed, as both herself and Ruth would be greatly
benefited if it were. Boaz, though not the nearest kinsman, on being made acquainted with the
circumstances of the case by Ruth, generously took up the cause; and the nearest of kin having
relinquished his claim, he redeemed the property with it; and, with Ruth's own free consent,
took her to be his wife. Her individual concurrence is apparent throughout the whole transaction.
No one had any right to sell at all, or otherwise to dispose of her, except by her own wish.

The rape of the Benjamites is sometimes referred to in terms expressive of the desire to cast
opprobium upon the teachings of the Bible. Unfortunate as was the condition of the Benjamites
on this occasion, they had no more sanction for what they did from the law of Moses, than had
Ahab for destroying the prophets of the Lord. Neither was the order of the Jewish elders for
the massacre of men and elderly women, and the saving of the four hundred young women to make
up the deficiency of wives still existing in this tribe, in any sense chargeable to the Divine law.

We might with as much propriety hold the Gospel responsible for the Massacre of St. Bartholomew,
as to hold the law of Moses responsible for the acts of the Israelites. The Mosaic precepts
concerning adultery and divorce might at first sight appear to give more latitude to men than
to women, and therefore to be partial; but when we accept the interpretation given by our Lord,
the apparent partiality vanishes. The Savior's testimony on the subject is very explicit. Matthew
xix, 3-10, we read: ""The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is
it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? It is manifest that the design of
God was, that there should be an equal fidelity on the part of both man and wife.

But, as ages rolled on, the depraved appetites of sinful mankind desired a different ordering
of the affairs of life. In the Jewish Commonwealth, the rabbis became less and less favorable
to the just rights of women, especially after their people began to intermix more freely with
their idolatrous neighbors; their precepts were assimilated more fully to those of the heathen;
and for doctrines, the commandments of men were taught instead of the pure law of God.

History proves that woman sometimes took a very prominent part in the public affairs of the
Jewish nation. But, while not attempting to disprove the statements which are therein recorded,
there are many who make light of any mention of the public labors of these women. Sometimes,
indeed, the talents and usefulness of these women, and of the earnest women of our own day,
are admitted after a fashion; but it is done in such a way as, in reality, to belittle the
sex as much as possible. They are considered as occupying the same relation to men that the
moon does to the sun, and all that is desired of them is to reflect a borrowed light. If she
be unable to reflect a light when there is none to borrow, what then? Even in religious matters,
she is judged to be incapable of taking any public part, though she may be ever so well informed
and pious, and those of the opposite sex in her vicinity ever so deplorably ignorant and wicked.
A few distinguished writers will, however, allow her--as a favor, it may be supposed--to go
out in public to collect money for charitable or Church purposes. What a wonder the funds so
collected are not defiled by passing through ""female"" fingers! Some of the religious denominations
who gladly accept of the fruit of women's labor, either in collecting from others or in giving
themselves, would yet not suffer a woman to pray or speak in public, though God has endowed
her with more than ordinary talent. She may not even give advice as to how the money she has
collected or given is to be expended. In the choir, women may sing of salvation; but it is
fearful presumption for her to speak of it in the body of the Church, or let her voice be heard
there imploring salvation for herself or others. This might defile the sanctuary or tempt her
to ""usurp authority over the man."" Occasionally there is to be found a denomination which will
allow a woman to pray in public, or to relate her Christian experience; but even in some of
these the practice does not receive a very large amount of encouragement, and her right to
exhort or teach publicly is seriously questioned, most frequently denied.

What was Scripture usage? From Exodus xv, 20, we learn that Miriam was a prophetess, and, in
the verse following, it appears that not only she, but the women of her company, took a prominent
part in the celebration of Israel's triumphant passage of the Red Sea. Not only was Miriam
a prophetess, but a joint leader with Moses and Aaron of that great host which went up to possess
the promised land, as is seen by reference to Micah vi, 4: ""For I brought thee up out of the
land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the land of servants, and I sent before thee Moses,
Aaron, and Miriam."" Thus did God, in the very beginning of the Jewish Church and nation, associate
a woman with men, giving her an equally responsible position with her brothers. Moses was the
lawgiver, Aaron the priest, and Miriam the seer. This threefold office was fulfilled in Christ;
and therefore Miriam, as well as Moses and Aaron, was a type of the Messiah.

If the Almighty had not designed women to occupy prominent positions, both civilly and ecclesiastically,
he certainly would not have qualified them to fill such places with honor; and history proves
that he did both qualify and employ them. Deborah was both a prophetess and a judge, and at
one time was the chief ruler in Israel, even leading on the hosts of the living God; for timorous
Barak would not go without her. Huldah, wife of Shallum, a prophetess who flourished in the
reign of Josiah, was consulted by him on matters of vital importance to his kingdom, although
both Jeremiah and Zephaniah were then alive. Josiah evidently considered her fully equal to
either of them, or he would not have consulted her, or at her dictation set about reforming
the abuses which were prevalent at the time. He could not have set to work more earnestly in
this good cause if Jeremiah had spoken to him. There have been learned men--and there are those
still--who think it exceedingly strange that Josiah should have condescended to send the messengers
to Huldah to inquire of the Lord, when he might have consulted either Jeremiah or one of the
brother prophets. Is it not equally strange that the Lord should have answered him by her mouth?
or rather should not his having done so, forever silence such questioning?

Other women have been emphatically the ""called,"" according to ""God's purpose,"" to combat evil
in countries even where women were treated with greater indignities than in Israel. We do not
make any distinction between prophets and prophetesses. Men and women were alike called to
the prophetic office, as God pleased, and kings and princes acknowledged their authority. Many
women became noted for their active service rendered to the Jewish Church and nation.

Women have proved themselves to be skillful diplomatists, and to be possessed of an equal amount
of courage and perseverance with men; but these capabilities have not always been employed
aright. There have been distinguished statesmen who have been frightfully wicked men; and,
unhappily, there have been clever women who have been fully their equals in wickedness. In
nothing is the mental equality of women with men more clearly indicated than in the manner
in which both pursue a career of sin.

Jezebel appears to have been a stronger-minded person than Ahab, and to have excelled him in
subtlety and wickedness. She was as active as he in pushing the persecution against the people
of God; indeed, more active and determined than her weak and wicked husband. At the time the
life of Elijah was threatened, she would seem not only to have been the more determined of
the two, but to have exercised greater authority over the realm. Athaliah, the daughter of
Jezebel, was no whit behind her mother in atrocious wickedness. Indeed, where women are brought
up in wickedness, they differ nothing in the depth of their depravity from men educated in
like manner.

The more frequently the Hebrews relapsed into idolatry, the less inclined were they to allow
women their legitimate privileges. The administrators of the laws constantly curtailed female
liberty, tenaciously exacting from them the service and obedience of slaves. A woman, even
among the Jews, must have had no small amount of both courage and wisdom, to have surmounted
the difficulties which hedged up the path to fame and honor, and risen to the distinction which
some of them reached. ""The rabbins""--not Moses--""taught that a woman should know nothing but
the use of her distaff."" Their idea of the education fitting for a woman was, that she should
understand merely how to manage the work of a house; in other words, know nothing but how to
minister to the appetites or whims of her husband, regarding him as her lord, her irresponsible
master. Rabbi Eliezer said, ""Let the words of the law be burned rather than that they should
be delivered to a woman."" Why, we wonder? Because they might, if they read it, learn what privileges
it accorded them, and perhaps claim them--a state of things to be prevented by any means, no
matter how unscrupulous.

Notwithstanding the teachings of the rabbins, however, and dark as was the day just prior to
the coming of the Messiah, we find a woman who was prophesying in the temple even then. The
prediction of Anna the prophetess is mentioned in the New Testament without a word of censure
on the unwomanliness of her conduct, or her profanation of the temple by it. Modern writers
would perhaps have been wiser, and treated her with what they considered deserved contempt.

CHAPTER V.

New Testament Teachings.

In this enlightened age, the sentiment of the Rabbi Eliezer, that the law should be burned
rather than delivered to women, would be execrated by the right-minded of every Christian country.
But was such a sentiment any farther from right, either in theory or practice, than are those
held and openly avowed by some of the advocates of the theory of the inferiority of women;
who, while asserting that these inferior creatures are, by the constitution of their minds,
incapable of comprehending the meaning of a law, yet hold them equally accountable with men--who
are supposed to understand all about it--for any violation of that law? If, indeed, there is
any difference made in the punishment of delinquents, the greater severity is most frequently
meted out to the woman.

Those who insist on the absolute, unqualified subjection of women to the opposite sex, and
place them in a subordinate place in the Christian Church, persistently quote the writings
of St. Paul as authority for the position which they take. We apprehend that the great apostle
to the Gentiles is as wrongfully misapprehended and misrepresented by certain classes of believers
now, as he was by the Jews at the memorable time when he was brought before Felix. Paul, therefore,
must ""answer for himself in the things whereof he is accused."" But every woman that prayeth
or prophesieth with her head uncovered, dishonoreth her head."" Here is a positive direction
given to a woman, as to the manner of her procedure when she either prayed or prophesied in
public, and not a prohibition of either act, as we might expect from the rendering given by
many divines.

Christ is the head of the man, because he is the first-born from the dead--the Redeemer of
mankind--and because ""he was before all things, and by him all things consist."" Having made
provision for the life of the world, he is therefore entitled to the love, devotion, and fidelity
of man. Christ is also mentioned under the figure of the vine, of which his people are the
branches.

Man is the head of the woman, because he was before her; and because, being physically stronger,
he has been constituted her protector. A man, therefore, is to love his wife ever as himself,
with an unselfish intensity, only to be compared with the love which Christ bears to his Church;
and the wife is bound by the same sacred law to be, in heart and practice, undeviating in her
love and fidelity to her husband.

""And the head of Christ is God."" Is Christ therefore not equal with God? Is there superiority
and inferiority between the Father and the Son? If because the apostle declares that the man
is the head of the woman, the proposition is to be taken for granted that, in consequence,
she is not his equal but an inferior, we may, with equal propriety and fairness, quote the
same text to prove, and prove as conclusively, that the Son is not equal with, but is inferior
to, the Father. God may be understood to be the head of Christ in regard to his manhood, and
that only. The Scriptures amply testify that he is not only co-eternal with the Father, but
coequal with him as well. There is neither inferiority nor superiority in the Divine nature
between the Father and the Son; and so also, since man and woman are derived from one nature,
being both human, there is neither superiority nor inferiority between them. They are coequal.

Is there, then, no distinction made between the sexes in the text? Certainly there is. Men
were directed to remove their caps or turbans when they prayed or prophesied in public, while
women, on the contrary, were to remain with their heads covered; that is, to keep veiled when
they prayed or prophesied in public. The latter, it is evident, was simply a prudential or
local arrangement. Throughout the East, and more especially in heathen countries, it was the
custom for women to be veiled when they made their appearance in public; but immodest women
not unfrequently violated the usage, appearing in public unveiled. In the state of society
then in Corinth, for a Christian woman to have appeared in public, or to have taken any prominent
part in an assembly with her head uncovered, would have placed her in a false position before
unbelievers, both Jews and Gentiles. That their liberty under the Gospel, then, might not be
made occasion of offense by gainsayers, against the cause of Christ, that their good should
not be evil spoken of by the profane multitude, the apostle counseled them to submit to the
usages and restraints which the customs of the times and place imposed on women, wherever the
usages or restraints so imposed were not in themselves sinful. In the same spirit he returned
Onesimus to his master; not that he thereby gave his sanction to slavery, but in this, as other
directions regarding civil affairs, advising submission to the existing state of things, ""that
the Gospel be not blamed."" The effecting of civil or political reforms, however much they might
be needed, was not the immediate object of Paul's preaching or writing. His grand, all-absorbing
business was to proclaim the Gospel in all its fullness, trusting to its benign influence to
right every wrong. ""The last days"" evidently means the Gospel dispensation; and this text alone,
twice given by inspiration, even if there were no other, would establish the right of women
to all the immunities and ordinances of the Christian Church. And if they will learn any thing,
let them ask their husbands at home, for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the Church.""

In the passage first quoted in this chapter, Paul gives explicit directions for the manner
in which women should be arrayed while speaking in the Church. Since, then, there can be no
contradiction in the Word of God, and we have positive proof that women did speak in public
assemblies by permission of the apostles, nothing remains but to reconcile the two texts so
apparently contradictory, by ascertaining to what kind of a public assembly the apostle had
reference in the text last quoted. By reference to the verses preceding this text in the fourteenth
chapter of First Corinthians, it will be seen that the apostle is pointing out the impropriety
and unprofitableness of speaking in unknown tongues; and of the contention and disorder that
then existed at Corinth. False teachers had caused dissension and tumults in the Church; and,
besides, the whole system of Christianity was violently assailed by both the Jews and the pagans.
The disciples at Corinth were in the midst of a great controversy. According to Eastern ideas,
it was an outrage upon propriety and decency, not only for a woman to take part by publicly
asking questions, or teaching in any such disorderly assembly, but even for her to be present
therein. To avoid the very appearance of evil, they were to absent themselves from these contentious
meetings because it was a shame for a woman to speak or contend in such riotous assemblies.
It is more than probable that Christian women had done so prior to this; and therefore Paul
warns them against such improprieties; not, however, forbidding them to pray or prophesy in
the Church, providing they ""covered their heads."" Nevertheless, lest the cause of God should
be hindered by women asserting their Christian liberty, by speech or action, he desired them
to comply with the common usages of the society in which they lived, where those usages were
not in themselves immoral or contrary to the Word of God. For a woman to attempt any thing
either in public or private that man claimed as his peculiar function, was strictly prohibited
by Roman law; and Christian women, as well as men, were to be submissive to the ""powers that
be."" Those who contend, from their rendering of these texts, that women are prohibited by them
from taking part in the public worship of God, to be consistent, should also insist that they
must not enter the house of God at all; because they are as strictly charged by Paul to remain
at home and learn in silence from their husbands, as to refrain from speaking.

Now, if women are to be silent in the Church; that is, if they are neither to pray, speak,
nor sing in public--for singing is certainly one method of conveying instruction to those who
hear, and is therefore teaching them how to ascribe praise to God--if they are, upon Scriptural
authority, to know nothing but what they may learn from their husbands at home,--then our whole
system of civilized education with regard to women is out of place; we had better borrow a
leaf from the Turks or Chinese. Girls here are sent to school, and encouraged to exert their
mental energies to the utmost in acquiring knowledge. Both mothers and daughters are taken
to church, and if they have tuneful voices they are expected to sing; all of which is manifestly
improper and unchristian, if women are to receive all religious instruction from their ""husbands
at home"" only, and in silence. The taking of women to church, or indeed out of the house, therefore,
is exposing them to the temptation of hearing and receiving instruction from unauthorized lips;
for--fearfully depraved though it may be in the sight of some--women are quite as prone as
men to listen to what is told them and to remember what they hear, and--worse still--to reason
out difficult problems for themselves.

And what is to be done for widows, or poor women who have never been blessed with husbands?
Are they to go down to death in heathenish darkness, because the genial light of a husband's
countenance has ceased to shine upon them, or, perhaps, has never done so? Must unmarried women
forever continue in ignorance of the glorious Gospel of Christ, because they have no husbands
to teach them? As girls, according to such a rendering, they ought not to have learned any
thing; for a father's teaching--if it were proper for him to give it--and a husband's might
differ widely. Besides, what is to be done for those women who are blessed with husbands incapable
of teaching them; or, as is notoriously so frequently the case, who choose rather to spend
their time in places of disreputable character than at their homes with their families!

Such a rendering of these texts as is frequently given, and the homilies derived therefrom,
are an outrage upon common sense. They are at variance with the direct teachings of St. Paul,
and contrary to what the Scriptures prove to have been his practice. Surely, none will dare
to accuse the apostle of inconsistency; and yet we have his own testimony that Phoebe was a
""servant of the Church at Cenchrea;"" that is, she was a deaconess, having a charge at Cenchrea.
Priscilla, quite as much as Aquila, was Paul's helper in ""Christ Jesus,"" acknowledged by him
as such. Priscilla was associated with Aquila in ""expounding the way of God more perfectly
to Apollos."" (Acts xvii, 62.) Strange that the great Apollos should receive religious instruction
from a woman; stranger still, if it were contrary to the will of God, that she was permitted
to give it! Why was she not severely rebuked for her presumption, and put in her place, and
taught to keep silence, as becometh a woman? On the contrary, creditable mention is made of
the fact that she did instruct him, and that through that instruction he was made useful to
the world; and all this upon the authority of inspiration, without one word of censure as to
her unwomanliness. Over and over again, Paul names her in his salutations.

In Philippians iv, 3, he entreats help for certain women, counting them as fellow-laborers.
""Help,"" says he, ""those women which labored with me in the Gospel."" Honorable mention, too,
is made by name of Tryphena, Tryphosa, and of the beloved Persis, who ""labored much in the
Lord."" Philip had four daughters which ""did prophesy"" (Acts xxi, 19); and we nowhere hear of
their being forbidden to do so. If Paul, influenced as he was by the Holy Spirit, had designed
to prevent women from attending religious meetings, or taking a public part therein, when there
would he have allowed all this laboring and prophesying and instructing to go on? Instead of
stopping it, however, he at different times commends Phoebe and her sister-laborers to the
kind regards of other Churches. Let the utterances of Paul be properly and fairly interpreted,
and it will be manifest that men and women are one in Christ Jesus. Decidedly, it is wrong
for a woman to usurp authority over the man; and just as decidedly wrong is it for a man to
usurp authority over the woman. According to history, the office of deaconess continued until
between the eleventh and twelfth centuries, when, the midnight of the Dark-Ages having come,
it was abolished in both the Greek and Latin Churches. Which sex usurped authority in that
case? Therefore as the Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands
in every thing."" (Eph. v, 22-24.)

From the verses preceding this quotation, and those following, it is evident the apostle had
reference to the marriage covenant, and not to the inferiority of woman or superiority of man.
Fidelity of wives to their husbands was the thing being enjoined; hence the comparison between
the marriage state and the Church of Christ. As the Church was to be pure from idolatry, acknowledging
but one God, even the Father, and Jesus Christ his Son, so the wife was to be pure, submitting
herself only to her husband. It is not surprising that, in planting the Christian Church, such
directions should be given to its members, gathered in as they were from a dark, immoral pagan
world, where the marriage tie was so lightly regarded. The husband should be to his wife the
earthly ""munition of rocks."" It is in this sense that the man is the head of the woman and
the Savior of her body. The apostle continues: ""So ought men to love their wives as their own
bodies."" ""Let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife
see that she reverence her husband."" Not worship him; but treat him with marked and becoming
respect, making his interest her own, loving him above every earthly object, and seeking his
happiness in every possible manner. It is in this mutual sense that a wife is to be subject
to her husband in every thing. Even the greatest sticklers for the absolute subjection of women
explain the latter clause of the text by adding the word lawful. If a woman's husband is to
be her irresponsible lord, to whom she is to go for instruction, who is the qualified judge
of what is lawful? But the reasoning of the entire question as given in the chapter, portions
of which have been quoted, does not bear out the assertion that the wife is mentally inferior
to her husband, or that he has any right to treat her as such. She is neither his servant nor
his slave, so far as God's law is concerned. The wife has the same right to expect fidelity
from her husband that he has to expect it from her. The covenant of marriage is a mutual one,
equally binding on both.

The injunction to the Ephesians concerning the relations in the married state is also given
to the Colossians, very evidently relating to the same thing: love and unwavering fidelity
between man and wife. Peter also enjoins the subjection of wives in his First Epistle, third
chapter, first and second verses; but he also explains that this subjection is chastity, mild
and gentle conversation, that their husbands, if not Christians, might be won over by them.
In this very injunction there is a supposition by the apostle that the husband and wife might
be of different faith, that she might have learned something not taught by him, and have been
in a position to instruct him; and by her chastity, her love and gentleness, and her instructions--coupled
with fear for his state out of Christ--might succeed in winning him to the truth.

Though Christianity greatly purified the moral atmosphere of the world, and caused those embracing
it to renounce polygamy, yet even those who had become Christian clung to the false assumptions
and arbitrary prerogatives claimed by men while yet in heathen darkness. To reconcile women
to the injustice done them, or to overawe them into submission, it was sought to make them
believe that the disabilities of their condition were by Divine appointment, though this doctrine
the apostles took pains to correct.

A lamentable amount of infidelity has been engendered by the manner in which the Scriptures
have been distorted to make them seem to sanction almost every social and civil wrong. They
have been quoted as authority for the absolute subjection of woman; and, with equal fairness,
for servile submission to despotic monarchs, for the use of intoxicating drinks, for the burning
of heretics, and for the justification of slavery. Within a very few years past, these very
Epistles have been brought forward to prove the ""sum of all villainies"" a God-given boon to
man, the slave included--Colossians iii, 22, being deemed unanswerable.

Those who advocated the cause of human freedom, who desired the privilege of worshiping God
according to the dictates of their own consciences, who strove to drive intemperance from the
land, or who pleaded for the liberty of the slave, were alike denounced as advocating what
was contrary to the revealed will of God; and in like manner, now, are those denounced who
advocate the perfect equality of woman with man. With regard to political and religious freedom,
the cause of temperance, and the slavery question, time has proved that the Lord of Hosts,
so far from being against, was on the side of, those who advocated these great reforms, and
led them on to victory; and there is no reason to doubt that this last reform will, by the
same hand, be led to similar triumph.

It is continually objected, that infidels, immoral men, and women of ill-repute, array themselves
upon the side of equal rights to women: so do infidels, libertines, and women lost to shame,
array themselves against it; therefore, the one counterbalances the other.

But suppose this were not so, to what would the objection amount? The cause of human freedom
has more than once been advocated by rank infidels; but did God therefore curse a cause good
in itself, because wicked men and women for once saw clearly, and said they thought that cause
right and reasonable? History answers, No. The children of this generation were simply wiser
than many of the children of light. The same may be said of each of the other reforms. The
abolition of slavery had its infidel advocates; so had the temperance movement, etc.; and these
advocates have to a certain extent damaged their respective causes by their advocacy of them;
yet the tide of human progress has been onward. A claim which is based upon justice may be
injured by an extravagant, irreverent, or profane advocacy; but it is still a just claim, and
as such, without respect to its advocates, entitled to recognition.

Polygamy, slavery, drunkenness, and the doctrine of the inferiority of woman to man, are all
alike the offspring of sin--all alike relics of barbarism--alike the enemies of God and human
freedom.

Long-established prejudices and old usages, no matter how false and oppressive, are, like the
everlasting hills, hard to be removed. But, as the mountains themselves have been overcome
by skill and hard work, and the valleys are being filled by persevering toil; as the crooked
is being made straight and the rough places plain, so that the people of this mighty continent
may travel with ease in palace-cars from sea to sea; so must the strong barriers of prejudice,
ignorance, misrepresentation, and indifference, be removed by the force of truth and sound
reason, and women be admitted to their legitimate position in society, with equal prerogatives
accorded to them, that they may thereby more perfectly exert their natural influence in improving
the world.

CHAPTER VI.

Woman Before the Law.

The fact that men and women are held amenable to the same Divine law, and held equally accountable
for any infraction of it, and that human law, with regard to criminal actions, is based upon
the same principle, clearly proves that God has created men and women, as a race, with equal
mental and moral capacity, and that, so far as it suited them to do so, men have acknowledged
the equality in framing the laws, especially those relating to the punishment for crimes committed.
It was only where masculine arrogance and selfishness were concerned, that the privileges of
equality were denied to women; and they are still denied for the same reason. Such is man's
consistency. If women, because of their sex--indeed, in consequence of it--are inferior to
men in mental and moral capacity, then it is unjust to judge them by the same law; for where
little is given little should be required. Imbecile men are not judged by the same code as
men of sound mind. If men and women are mentally and morally equal--and we hold they are--then
they are justly held to be equally accountable by the laws, provided they have been equally
represented in the making of those laws; and if held equally accountable with men to the laws,
they ought, in common justice, to be entitled to the enjoyment of equal immunities with men,
and an equal voice in the making of the laws that are to govern them.

To urge that, because the house is the legitimate place for a woman, she is therefore inferior
to man, and in consequence ought not to enjoy the same rights, is no more logical than to contend
that, because the farm is the legitimate place for the farmer, he is therefore inferior to
the lawyer, who is somewhat better skilled in legal lore, and that consequently the farmer
is not entitled to equal political and religious rights and privileges with the lawyer; or
that, because neither of these classes understands the minutiae of housekeeping, therefore
they are inferior to women, and in consequence not entitled to equal rights and privileges
with them. Good housekeeping is quite as essential to the world's good, and to the healthful
development of humanity, as good farming or the proper construing of well-made laws, neither
of which is to be undervalued. Where, then, is the inferiority?

It requires as much good judgment and tact to manage a house properly as it does to conduct
a farm, make out a legal form, carry on an extensive commercial business, or attend to a banking
establishment as it ought to be attended to; and quite as much wisdom and prudence are needed
to rear up successfully and govern a family with discretion, as is needed in the government
of a province or state. Indeed more practical good sense is shown in the government of the
majority of those homes where the wife and mother is allowed to govern without interference,
than is usually exhibited in the exclusively masculine government of states and empires.

It ""is the mind that makes the man,"" sings one of Britain's most honored poets; the mind, not
the social position he occupies. And so with woman; it is the mind, and not her local habitation
or employment, that entitles her to consideration--that entitles her to equality, to justice.
With equal advantages, women are no whit behind men in any thing except physical strength.
Are men deprived of civil rights because some of them are puny?

It is an established fact that, where girls have had the same advantages, and often when they
have had not nearly such good ones, they have maintained equally honorable positions in their
classes, frequently outstripping their masculine competitors in the literary contest.

Should any doubt that this can be done, all that is necessary, to prove the truth or falsity
of the assertion, is to select any given number of boys and girls of average intellect, of
the same or nearly the same ages, and afford precisely the same advantages to them all, for
a given length of time, and then subject boys and girls to a like critical examination. Even
with the disadvantages under which they labor in our ordinary and even higher schools, girls
have surmounted the difficulties of their position, and without favor--indeed, in spite of
ridicule, partiality, and opposition--have come out first in their examinations. Send such
a class of young women as this to a university that will honestly admit them to all its advantages,
and allow them to compete with the most studious young men admitted to the same university;
let both enjoy precisely similar facilities throughout the entire course; and see if there
will not be as many brilliant scholars who will graduate with honors among the women as among
the men. It is said there are more talented men, more men eminent in science or in history,
than there are women. Certainly. The advantage has all been on the side of the man, the disadvantage
on the side of the woman; besides which, the doctrine that it is unwomanly to emerge from the
retirement befitting her sex into public notice has been preached so persistently, that many
women truly great have shrunk from the ribald criticism--to use no stronger term--with which
insolent men assailed them. Consequently, learned women have frequently given their works to
the world anonymously, or allowed them to be attributed to their male relatives. An instance
in point is Miss Herschel. It is well known, not only that she gave her brother valuable assistance
in his astronomical pursuits, but that some of the discoveries attributed to him were actually
made by her; not because he wished to defraud her of the honor of her achievement, but because
she shrank from public notice.

But history has given us the record of learned women enough to show that, with any thing like
fair play, there would have been more. As it is, the list of them is longer--very much longer--than
those given to decry their ability are willing to admit, or are perhaps aware of. The names
of women are found who have been famous for the founding of empires, the carrying on successfully
of civil governments, and the leading on to glorious victory of armies which, under the generalship
of men, had suffered defeat after defeat, till they were not only disheartened, but almost
disorganized; and yet a woman reorganized these shattered bands and roused them once more to
determined action. They have been found, in times of trouble, giving to statesmen sound counsel,
which, followed, has led to beneficial results; and, alas! they have, equally with men, been
found capable of base intrigue. Cleopatra was fully on a par with Marc Antony, Madame de Pompadour
with Richelieu or Mazarin.

Women noted for piety and for patriotism are not found lacking on this list. Retired lives
as they have led, compared with men, history, both sacred and profane, abounds with them. They
shine out conspicuously, bright lights in a very dark world. Miriam stands side by side with
Moses, Deborah a little in advance of Barak. They contribute their jewels to adorn the tabernacle
or to save the State; and, in time of need, they cheerfully endure every privation, that the
commonwealth may prosper. They were found last lingerers about the cross, and the first to
visit the sepulcher of Christ; and they were the first commissioned by him to proclaim his
resurrection.

In philanthropic enterprise, Mrs. Fry is the peer of Howard. Who, among men, have been found
to excel the world-honored Florence Nightingale in intelligent arrangements and administrative
talent, as displayed in her management of the important department to which she devoted herself,
and where her courage, promptitude, and sound judgment were as conspicuous as her sweet, womanly
compassion?

Similar qualities distinguish in a marked degree both Miss Rye and Miss McPherson, and also
the power of influencing and controlling juveniles unaccustomed to moral restraints. These,
though only a few of the many noble women whose business talents have been used to bless the
needy and suffering, may suffice to prove that women have not only the heart to devise philanthropic
undertakings, but the ability to carry them out successfully.

Mothers of great mental power rear sons whose names never die. The mother of the Wesleys, and
the mother of Washington, are named as reverently as are these illustrious men themselves.
In fine, how few great men there are who do not, when they speak upon the subject, attribute
their greatness or success to their mothers!

Since, then, women have in a measure shown the capabilities of which they are possessed, it
remains to be ascertained what rights and privileges are accorded them, and to be shown whether
these are in any proportion to what they are entitled to; and, as the women of Europe and America
enjoy more liberty than those of the other portions of the globe, it is their condition that
will be inquired into. Whatever may be amiss in Christianized and civilized lands, the state
of woman is incomparably worse where the light of the Gospel does not shine.

Christianity and its attendant civilization have done much for the amelioration of the condition
of woman. Except in Turkey and in Utah, the idea that a man is to have more than one wife at
the same time is not tolerated. In referring to the continents of Europe and America, it will
be understood that Turkey in the one, Utah in the other, are always excepted. In neither Europe
nor America are women subject to the surveillance of the East; they are not bought and sold
in the markets. They are, if they do not marry before coming of age, mistresses of their own
personal actions. The halls of science, literature, and the arts, have been partially opened
to them. The doors have been set ajar, and they allowed to peep in. They may now attend the
house of God without being railed in behind a lattice; and they may, without censure, move
about the streets without veils, if it is not the fashion, or it does not please them to wear
them. They are accorded a measure of liberty in forming their own religious opinions; that
is, the law does not prevent them from doing so. They may, if they can, acquire property in
their own names, or they may inherit it. In such cases they, perhaps, if unmarried, may be
allowed to manage such property. Once married, it is managed, or mismanaged, as the case may
be, by the husband, except in very special cases. They are not compelled by law to marry unless
they choose, and are supposed to have a choice with regard to those they do marry, though outside
pressure is very frequently brought to bear with regard to both. And, finally, they are allowed
a share of authority in the joint government of their respective families. This is about the
sum total of the privileges accorded to them.

In the population of both continents, men and women are about equally divided. It is not estimated
that there are any more idiots or imbeciles among women than there are among men. Here, then,
one-half of this mighty population are prohibited by law from having any voice in the making
of the laws by which they are governed, or the carrying of them out after they are made. Where
is justice in this case? One slight exception may be made here: in some of the Western States
women are allowed to vote and to hold some few positions of profit and trust in the State.
It is only a trifling advantage, but still it is an advantage, and is one step gained in the
right direction.

The law allows the mother's holiest feelings to be outraged with impunity. It does not recognize
her right to the custody of her own children, except at the husband's pleasure. She may be
intelligent and educated, virtuous and pious. Yet, if he so wills, he may remove her children
from her care, deprive her of their society, and even of the comfort of occasionally seeing
them; and he may place them under the tutelage of the ignorant and vicious; while the deeply
wronged mother is powerless, according to law, to help either herself or her children.

It is counted among one of woman's privileges that she may hold property in her own right.
Upon what tenure is she allowed to hold it? If the property be acquired or inherited, without
entail of any sort; if it be real estate, it is hers in fee-simple till she marries. After
that event--unless she has guarded her rights by a legal pre-nuptial contract, properly signed
and attested to by him who is to be her husband--she may not dispose of any part of it without
his express sanction. He may not legally sell it away from her, it is true; but by law he is
her master, and may manage it according to his supreme pleasure while he lives. Even a will
made by her does not take effect, except her husband pleases, till his death. If the property
be in ready money or in funds--except it be guarded in the contract--the husband becomes possessed
of it at once, and may appropriate and apply it to any purpose he pleases, without consulting
the wishes of his wife. She has no redress. He may, despite her remonstrances, take this her
substance and her money, and spend it in foolish speculation; or, worse still, in gambling,
drunkenness, and debauchery. He may maltreat her and insult her by the presence in her own
house of his mistress. If, no longer able to endure his brutality, she is obliged to leave
him, he may, unless the law grant a divorce and alimony, keep possession of her houses and
lands, while she must leave home and children behind, and go out upon the world penniless.
She can not force him to return one dollar of the wealth that was her own; and after the separation,
unless legal papers warranting it have been executed, he can follow her and collect her scanty
earnings. Thousands upon the back of thousands of times has all this occurred. Does not civilized
law give a woman a lien upon her husband's property? and does not this counterbalance his lien
upon hers? About as equally as are all other privileges balanced between the sexes; no more.

She has no legal voice whatever in the management of her husband's estate. His real estate
is the only thing upon which she has any claim, and this is only a life interest--after his
death--of the one-third of the estate; and of this she may only draw the interest upon the
valuation. She may refuse to bar her dower[K] in a sale of land, but if the bargain goes on,
her refusal does not invalidate the title; all she can do is, in the event of her husband's
death, to claim her interest on her ""thirds."" This is all she can claim. The furniture of her
home, the very beds which she may have brought to the house, are included in the inventory
of her husband's effects; and, unless she agrees to accept them as part of her thirds, she
may be left without, one on which to rest her weary limbs; and that, too, though the property
may have been purchased with money brought by her into the matrimonial firm; or though she
may have been the working-bee who in reality acquired it. This is not an overdrawn picture.
It is the law in civilized countries; and men are found every day who avail themselves of its
conditions. That all men are not mean enough to take advantage of such laws, is no excuse for
their existence. It is barbarous that, by laws in the enacting of which women have had no voice,
they are left to the mercy of unscrupulous men, without the possibility of better men coming
to their help, except by repealing the iniquitous statutes.

It is quite true that all women are not made to feel the full force of this bitter oppression,
because of the kindness of their husbands, or the prudent forethought of their fathers in providing
for unlooked-for emergencies which might occasion poverty or distress; but the laws, and the
makers of them, deserve little credit for any comfort or degree of independence enjoyed by
women. More sorrowful than it is, infinitely more sorrowful, would woman's condition be, if
true Christianity had not made many men more just than the laws require them to be. Many of
the slaves had kind masters; but was slavery any the less an iniquitous outrage upon humanity,
a curse upon the land, a blot that could only be wiped away by a bloody war? The present social
condition of women is merely one system of domestic slavery, which is hourly calling out to
God for redress; and, though he tarry long, yet his afflicted children's cry is never lifted
up in vain.

Society is even yet so constituted, and the minds of those who are administrators of the law
so blinded, by the prejudices which long usage has established, that even the very few laws
which are on record for her so-called protection, are rendered of little avail.

The sufferings of women and children from the effects of the liquor-traffic, is perfectly frightful;
and what help is there for it? Lately, in Canada, the wife may, after she is reduced to poverty,
forbid the dram-seller to sell her husband any more liquor. If he pays attention to the prohibition,
well and good; if not, when in a drunken fit the husband has well-nigh killed her, she may
have him bound over to keep the peace--if she can find a magistrate who will do it--and she
may complain of the man who sold him the liquor. Perhaps he will be fined a dollar, perhaps
not. More likely the latter, with a not very gentle hint that she has stepped out of her sphere
by presuming to meddle in such matters.

If women had a voice in the making of the laws, how long would the dram-shop and low groggery
send out their liquid poison to pollute civilized lands? But all women are not on the side
of right. Neither are the very large majority of men. Many women are drunkards themselves,
and worse. True, alas! too true. Sin has corrupted human nature, and men and women have sunk
to fearful depths of degradation. Statistics go to show, however, that fallen women happily
bear only a very small proportion to those upon whose moral character there is no stain. The
virtuous and good are in the large majority.

Men are not allowed by law to murder their wives. Indeed, the law forbids them to beat them;
but for this trifle, husbands frequently escape with an ""admonition."" Yet, though the letter
of the law is explicit, they must stop short of killing their victims. There is a case on record,
within a few years back and in a British province, where a man beat his wife to death. He was
found guilty of the crime. The jury--composed of men, of course--brought in a verdict of manslaughter,
and he was sentenced to three months in the common jail. The plea in his behalf was that she
was a drunkard. The poor fellow had only gone a little too far; the court must be merciful.
At this same assize, there was a man indicted for theft. He had made good his entrance into
a jeweler's shop, and stolen therefrom a watch. The theft was proved, and the culprit sent
to the penitentiary for three years. Query: Which was the greater crime, killing a woman or
stealing a watch?

The law professes to punish seduction and rape; but when either or both are proved, what are
the sentences? In nine cases out of ten, scarcely so severe as for damaging an animal belonging
to a neighbor. Occasionally, when the cases have been atrociously aggravating, a man has been
hung for poisoning his wife, or one has been sent to the penitentiary for rape; but the instances
are more frequent in which the criminal escapes punishment. It is contended that, usually,
the women who are murdered, or otherwise maltreated, are ill-tempered, drunken creatures, and
therefore not worthy the protection of the law. Would these same parties contend that because
a man was ill-tempered, drunken, or dissolute, therefore his wife was scarcely to be punished
for foully murdering him? Not at all. The universal testimony would be that she was a shockingly
wicked wretch.

Women, as well as men, have to contend with infirmities of temper; and they quite as well succeed
in controlling or keeping them in check. There are both men and women, unfortunately, who let
their evil passions run riot till they are torments to all who have any thing to do with them.
Some women, naturally gentle and kind, have been so ill-treated, so shamefully tyrannized over,
that in process of time the ""milk of human kindness in their breasts has turned to gall;"" and
the gall is then bitter enough. Would not men, in similar circumstances, be just as bitter?

There is a certain class of women, however, who as a rule are likely to become fretful and
ill-tempered as they grow in years: girls who are allowed to grow up with uninformed judgments,
who are taught that the chief end and aim of woman is to captivate and please the opposite
sex, who are taught to think a pretty face and delicate figure of more importance than good
sense or a thorough education. And yet it is a fact worthy of notice, that those who most eloquently
assert their great superiority over the entire sex, are the very men most easily led--ay, and
duped--by dressy, frivolous, brainless women. It would be a misfortune, scarcely to be endured,
for such men to have wives who know too much.

That there should be a head to every family, is self-evident. A man and his wife, according
to Scripture, should be one; and the corporate head is best qualified to govern a family, or
manage an estate in which both have a common interest, and therefore ought to have an equal
voice. What one lacks, the other may have. The man may be overconfident, the woman too cautious;
by counseling together, a proper and safe medium is arrived at.

One-half of the property in the matrimonial firm should always be regarded as belonging to
the wife. And if a man and his wife fail to agree as to the advantage, or even safety, of a
proposed scheme, and he is still determined to act upon his own judgment, contrary to that
of his wife, he should never, in such case, risk more than one-half of the property.

What right has a man, except that ""might makes right,"" to hazard all he has in wild speculations,
or by indorsing for some friend or boon companion, despite his wife's expostulations, or without
her knowledge? Yet it is done every day, and all lost; and if women who see their children
and themselves thus reduced to poverty, complain, they are stigmatized as fretful, unwomanly
grumblers. Their husbands, says the world, had a right to do as they pleased with the property
in their possession. What if the wife had earned or inherited half, or even the whole, of it!
what should women know about business?

In indorsing, especially, a man should be restrained by law, under pains and penalties, from
indorsing to amounts exceeding one-half of his property; and no indorsement in excess of that
amount should be allowed to constitute a legal claim.

But is it really right to indorse for any one, under any circumstances? Why should a third
party encumber his estate, and run the risk of ruining himself and his family, to secure the
payment of a debt in which he has no personal interest, simply to make a capitalist secure
in the investing of his funds, or in the profitable disposal of his property on credit? If
the lender can not trust the party who deals directly with him, let there be no credit. It
is manifestly a departure from the line of duty for a man to jeopard the means of maintenance
for his family, without any prospect of advantage to himself or them. It is as much a great
moral wrong for a man to rob his wife and children as it is to rob strangers, although commercial
usage and the laws of mankind may declare the reverse. ""He that is surety for a stranger shall
smart for it: and he that hateth suretyship is sure."" (Proverbs xi, 15.)

It may be said that to refuse to indorse would retard trade. Let it be retarded, then; for
why should the capitalist have two chances to the trader's one? If the man trusted is unsuccessful,
why, to enrich the capitalist who loans his money for his own gain, should an innocent family
be impoverished, who reaped no benefit, and were expected to reap no benefit, from the transaction?
How many families have thus been brought to ruin, the day of Judgment alone will reveal.

In many countries the law of primogeniture prevails, though, happily, in the United States
and Canada it has been abolished. Whether the interests of the mothers and younger members
of families ever were in any degree the better provided for by every thing being placed at
the absolute disposal of the eldest son, is a doubtful question. It may have been that, in
the old barbaric times, when women and children were a prey to every bold marauder who chose
to prey upon them, that the law was intended for their protection, the eldest son or brother
being the person most likely to be able to protect them; and the property, not being subdivided
and scattered, was more easily defended; and it might have been expected that natural affection
would cause the heir to deal justly with his mother and the other children.

But with the passing away of these days of barbarous forays, passed away the need of any such
arrangement; if indeed any good ever was accomplished by it. Certainly, much mischief has been
wrought and foul injustice sanctioned by it, for many centuries.

An arrangement so well calculated to foster selfishness and arrogance, so long established,
produced its legitimate fruit. Since at his father's death every thing, or nearly so, would
come under his control, the eldest son became the one important member of his family. As his
mother could have but her interest on the third of the value of the estate, unless specially
provided for by marriage settlement, she necessarily became dependent upon him who inherited
the estate; and therefore the lad, even while a lad, was constantly deferred to, until he deemed
himself superior to the rest of his family. The elder members of a family might have been girls,
and, there being no boys, might have arrived at the conclusion that the property of their father
might be theirs; but a boy born late in the life of their father would sweep away the delusion,
and leave them to poverty. Eldest sons have been known to send their brothers and sisters out
into the world penniless, and sell from over their mothers' heads the homes in which they had
hoped to die, obliging them to subsist or starve, as they might, upon their meagre ""thirds.""
Whether justice to mother or children was done or not, depended entirely upon this one boy.
And this was the brightest side of primogeniture. In cases of entailed property, very often
the entail specified that it was to go to the heir male for all time. A father in this case,
dying without a son, could do nothing besides willing to these girls such loose property as
he might have acquired independently of his estate. It might revert to his daughter's most
bitter enemy; it was not in his power to help it.

From the hour of a woman's birth to her death, there is a continuous system of belittling her,
which, if it does not succeed in destroying her self-respect, thus teaching her that she may,
as her only means of retaliation, allow herself in any little meanness which may occur to her,
is so galling to that self-respect, that the wonder is that her very nature has not become
revolutionized. But women have so long been trained in this school, that they have, to a large
extent, adopted the language expressive of their own inferiority, if not the sentiment itself.

Emma and John, as children, play together; Emma aged five and John three years respectively.
Their toys are suited to their sex--Emma's a doll, John's a toy carriage and ponies. For a
time all goes on harmoniously; they use each other's toys indiscriminately; for as yet their
minds have not been contaminated by outside influences. By and by, as will come in play, both
children wish entire possession of the same toy. There is a contest, and John appeals to mother:
""Emma has my carriage, and won't give it up."" ""For shame!"" says mother, ""Emma, give John his
toy directly. Don't you know that a carriage with ponies is a toy for little gentlemen? Besides,
if you are good, when you both grow up perhaps he will give you a ride with real carriage and
live ponies."" Awed by the command, and charmed by the distant prospect of the actual ride,
the little girl--as indeed she ought--gives up the toy, and peace is restored for the time.
But presently a shrill cry is heard: ""Johnnie's rubbing all the paint off my dolly's cheeks.
He won't give her to me. O, he has broken her arm."" The mother's reply to this cry is stern
and sharp. ""Don't be so cross with your little brother."" Then to John. ""O, John, you ought
not to have broken sister's pretty dolly; it wasn't half so nice as your own little carriage
and ponies. Why didn't you play with them? Boys should be gentlemen. Emma is only a little
girl;"" with a tone emphatic of inferiority upon the word girl. ""Little boys should never stoop
to play with girl's toys."" Later on, where a girl's enjoyment is in a measure provided for
in connection with her brother, he is made almost invariably the purse-bearer. What she has
is of his generosity. Girls must be yielding, submissive, and dependent, as becomes their sex.
Boys may be overbearing or rough; it is a sign of a manly spirit to be so.

Thus arrogance and injustice is fostered in the boy, and a sense of wrong begotten in the girl;
the one is degraded in her own eyes, and in the eyes of her brother; the other is elevated
above his just level in his own eyes and his sister's; and heart-burning and jealousies engendered
that often last through life. A girl may hardly choose her own husband. Her father, brother,
or some friend will introduce some eligible party. She is an undutiful girl if--when he honors
her by asking her hand--she do not thankfully consent. To the credit of humanity be it said,
that girls have more liberty of choice in this respect than they had formerly. There is still
room for improvement. The sooner match-making and match-makers die out, the better for the
world. If man or woman make a mistake in marrying unfortunately, and in consequence suffer
unhappiness, let those more fortunately situated, pity and be kind to the sufferer; but let
none incur the responsibility of having made such a match.

CHAPTER VII.

Woman and Legislation.

What rights, it may be asked, ought women to have accorded to them which they do not now enjoy
according to law? From what rights does custom debar them? We claim that women, being held
equally responsible to the law with men, are as well entitled to have a voice in making that
law. It is a fundamental principle of all governments, not despotic, that ""taxation without
representation"" is a gross infringement upon the civil rights of the subject or citizen. When,
in spite of the disadvantages under which women labor, they have, by unflagging industry and
prudent management, acquired real estate, their property is taxed according to the same rule
by which the property of men is taxed; and still the elective franchise is denied them. Men
in legislating for men know their wants and understand their particular needs, because they
have experience of them; but in legislating for women they look at things from their own stand-point;
and because of its being impossible for them to experience the various annoyances and humiliations
to which women are subjected, they do not realize the injustice toward women of the existing
state of things, or the nature and extent of the changes which justice to them requires. To
secure any thing like impartial justice in civil affairs for women, they should have an equal
voice in making the laws.

It is contended that, if women were entitled to the franchise, it would make no difference
with a party vote, since as many women would vote on one ticket as on the other. What of it?
The franchise has been extended from time to time for centuries to various classes of men,
and these classes did not, as a class, confine themselves to one particular ticket or party.
Was it any the less the unalienable right of these men to enjoy their liberty to vote as they
saw fit, or as they deemed for the best interests of the country? Certainly not. Neither is
it just that women should be denied the right to vote because it would make no perceptible
difference to a party ticket.

If women had a right to vote, say some, it would occasion family contention. Why should it?
If a woman thinks as her husband, she will vote as he does; if not, none but an unreasonable
and overbearing man would insist that his wife must think as he does, and vote in accordance
with his views, whether they agree with her own or not. It would be quite as just and as reasonable
to urge that, because the peace of families is sometimes disturbed by fathers and sons voting
for opposite parties, therefore, the sons should not be allowed to exercise the franchise during
the life-time of their fathers. There are differences of opinion concerning politics in families
now; there always have been, and always will be, unless some process can be devised whereby
women will be deprived of the power of thought. Are these existing differences less to be deprecated
than those likely to result from extending the franchise to women? How can it be supposed that
the peace of families is secured by men only having the liberty to give practical expression
to their views, by recording votes which may tell for the good or ill of the country, while
women have not? though very frequently a woman has the outrage put upon her of knowing that
her husband is recording a vote upon her property, not his, for a party to which she is conscientiously
opposed. And this in a civilized, not a barbarous, land! Where is either the justice or the
moral honesty of such a course of procedure? Surely, if a woman did vote for a candidate or
for a measure to which her husband is opposed, it is no worse, and ought to produce no more
disturbance in the family, than for him to vote for a candidate or measure to which she is
opposed, especially where the property qualification is in her own right, or where--as is very
frequently the case--she has worked equally hard in earning it; nor would disturbance be produced
by it at any time, were men as much disposed to be just as women are to forgive injury.

Then, there are many intelligent, industrious, and enterprising women who never marry; and
many more who do, are left widows early in life, and remain so to its end. These women contribute
quite as much to the public good as do unmarried men in similar circumstances. Why, then, should
the one enjoy the privilege of the ballot-box or the polls, and it be denied to the other?
There is no just reason whatever. Nothing but usage makes such an injustice tolerated; nothing
but the love of arbitrary power causes it to be advocated.

The assertion that the majority of women care nothing about politics or the exercise of any
right not now enjoyed by them, is about as true as the asseverations of those who opposed the
passage of the late ""Reform Bill"" in England, that the majority of the middle and poorer classes
were satisfied with the privileges enjoyed, and would scarcely--the poorer classes especially--be
able to vote intelligently if the privilege were allowed. It was roundly asserted, too, that
all this reform agitation was the work of demagogues and infidels. Time has proved that the
common people of England were able to record intelligent votes, and that they did prize the
privileges which were so reluctantly granted; neither is infidelity any more rampant since
liberty has been given to the people to express their opinions than it was before. Indeed,
it has less material upon which to feed and grow than it then had. It is asserted by reverend
divines that, to accord women equal rights and privileges with men, is to countenance infidelity.
Such assertions have yet to be proved to be truthful. Logically, the position is untenable.
There are many thousands more infidels among men than among women. How, then, can these divines
make it appear that giving to women equal civil and political privileges with men would countenance
infidelity, or tend to its increase? Women being so much more generally religiously disposed
than men, the influence of the former, if allowed its due weight in public affairs, would be
much more likely to neutralize the influence of the infidel men now exercising the rights and
privileges from which women are debarred, and would thus contribute to the development of a
higher moral and religious tone in community. Apply these men's theory to themselves, and they
would quickly observe its absurdity, as well as its shameful injustice. It is said, too, that
women are amply represented by their husbands, brothers, or fathers; which is not true, since
wives do not always think as their husbands do; daughters do not always see matters from the
same stand-point that their fathers do, any more than sons; and sisters do not agree in opinion
with brothers, any more than brothers agree with brothers. It is a well-known fact that, in
all countries, fathers and sons have entertained different views, both political and religious,
and have given public expression of them; so, also, brothers have arrayed themselves against
brothers in civil and ecclesiastical contests. It is absurd, therefore, to say that one member
of a family--even though he be the ""head""--of necessity represents the views of the entire
family. But, supposing it were true that the thing could be done, it would be just as reasonable
for women to represent their fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers at the polls as to be represented
there by them.

It is urged that many women are frivolous, that they seem scarcely to have a serious thought,
that the energies of their minds--if they have any--are bent upon the acquirement of a thorough
knowledge of the latest foreign fashion, heedless whether they ruin father or husband or not.
So there are--those especially who are taught to think it very ""unfeminine"" to be ""strong-minded""
enough to be independent, who deem it a fearful thing to bend mind or body to work for their
own living, asserting, with an unwitting sarcasm, that ""papa"" or ""husband"" is the responsible
head of the house, and that it is his business to supply their wants. There are frivolous young
men, too, in this world of ours, whose whole minds seem bent on the exquisite parting of their
back hair, the peculiar shape of their collar and shade of gloves or neck-tie, and the exact
height of the heel of their French boots; men who run up bills and ruin fathers and wives without
any apparent compunctions of conscience, and who feel no shame that their wives or daughters
support them while they squander both time and money. Yet these men, frivolous as it is possible
to be, are not denied equal privileges with the rest of their sex, nor is their frivolity pleaded
as a reason why sensible men should not be allowed the franchise.

Why, then, should the frivolity of some women be urged against the whole sex? Rather, educate
them. Let them realize that they are equally with man responsible to God for the powers of
mind given them. And let them know, too, that they shall have equal opportunities for the development
and exercise of those powers; that with equality in responsibility there is equality in privilege;
and the next half-century will number fewer frivolous women--by many hundreds.

The dread is entertained by some that, if granted the elective franchise, women would be mixed
up in election rows and drunken squabbles, as men are now. Such an event does not necessarily
follow; neither is it at all probable. Men of good principle and well-balanced judgment do
not make either fools or beasts of themselves now, badly as elections are managed; nor would
sensible, right-minded women degrade themselves by unseemly conduct while exercising their
right to vote.

No law has ever yet existed which entirely prevented evil-minded men and evil-minded women
from making public exhibition of their degradation; and, as society is now constructed, where
wicked men congregate, some wicked women will be found. Elevate women to perfect equality with
man, and fewer wicked ones will prey upon society.

The great objection, the one which rises above all others, with regard to women taking an active
part in civil and ecclesiastical matters, is, that they would thereby neglect their houses
and families.

This objection has some weight; it is not altogether so unreasonable as most of the others
raised. But even here the event dreaded does not necessarily follow, any more than because
men are allowed to vote therefore their business and families must suffer in consequence. When surprised
by sportsmen in the depths of the jungle, individuals of a herd are always occupied in swinging
their limbs in this manner; and in the several corrals which I have seen, where whole herds
have been captured, the elephants in the midst of the utmost excitement, and even after the most vigorous
charges, if they halted for a moment in stupor and exhaustion, manifested their wonted habit,
and swung their limbs or swayed their bodies to and fro incessantly. So far from its being a
substitute for exercise, those in the government employment in Ceylon are observed to practise
their acquired motion, whatever it may be, with increased vigour when thoroughly fatigued
after excessive work. Even the favourite practice of fanning themselves with a leafy branch
seems less an enjoyment in itself than a resource when listless and at rest. The term ""fidgetty""
seems to describe appropriately the temperament of the elephant.

[Footnote 1: Menageries, &c., ""The Elephant,"" ch. i. p. 21.]

They evince the strongest love of retirement and a corresponding dislike
to intrusion.

The approach of a stranger is perceived less by the eye, the quickness of which is not remarkable
(besides which its range is obscured by the foliage), than by sensitive smell and singular acuteness
of hearing; and the whole herd is put in instant but noiseless motion towards some deeper and
more secure retreat. The effectual manner in which an animal of the prodigious size of the elephant
can conceal himself, and the motionless silence which he preserves, is quite surprising; whilst
beaters pass and repass within a few yards of his hiding place, he will maintain his ground
till the hunter, creeping almost close to his legs, sees his little eye peering out through the
leaves, when, finding himself discovered, the elephant breaks away with a crash, levelling
the brushwood in his headlong career.

If surprised in open ground, where stealthy retreat is impracticable, a herd will hesitate in indecision,
and, after a few meaningless movements, stand huddled together in a group, whilst one or two, more
adventurous than the rest, advance a few steps to reconnoitre. Elephants are generally observed
to be bolder in open ground than in cover, but, if bold at all, far more dangerous in cover than
in open ground.

In searching for them, sportsmen often avail themselves of the expertness of the native trackers;
and notwithstanding the demonstration of Combe that the brain of the timid Singhalese is deficient
in the organ of destructiveness[1], he shows an instinct for hunting,
and exhibits in the pursuit of the elephant a courage and adroitness
far surpassing in interest the mere handling of the rifle, which is
the principal share of the proceeding that falls to his European companions.

[Footnote

1: System of Phrenology, by GEO. COMBE, vol. i. p. 256.]

The beater on these occasions has the double task of finding the game and carrying the guns;
and, in an animated communication to me, an experienced sportsman describes ""this light and active
creature, with his long glossy hair hanging down his shoulders, every muscle quivering with excitement;
and his countenance lighting up with intense animation, leaping from
rock to rock, as nimble as a deer, tracking the gigantic game like
a blood-hound, falling behind as he comes up with it, and as the elephants,
baffled and irritated, make the first stand, passing one rifle into
your eager hand and holding the other ready whilst right and left
each barrel performs its mission, and if fortune does not flag, and
the second gun is as successful as the first, three or four huge carcases
are piled one on another within a space equal to the area of a dining
room.""[1]

[Footnote 1: Private letter from Capt. PHILIP PAYNE GALLWEY.]

It
is curious that in these encounters the herd never rush forward in
a body, as buffaloes or bisons do, but only one elephant at a time
moves in advance of the rest to confront, or, as it is called, to
""charge,"" the assailants.

I have heard of but one instance in which two so advanced as champions of their companions.
Sometimes, indeed, the whole herd will follow a leader, and manoeuvre in his rear like a body
of cavalry; but so large a party are necessarily liable to panic; and, one of them having turned
in alarm, the entire body retreat with terrified precipitation.

As regards boldness and courage, a strange variety of temperament is observable amongst elephants,
but it may be affirmed that they are, much more generally timid than courageous. One herd
may be as difficult to approach as deer, gliding away through the jungle so gently and quickly
that scarcely a trace marks their passage; another, in apparent stupor, will huddle themselves
together like swine, and allow their assailant to come within a few yards before they break away
in terror; and a third will await his approach without motion, and then advance, with fury
to the ""charge.""

In individuals the same differences are discernible; one flies on the first appearance of danger,
whilst another, alone and unsupported, will face a whole host of enemies. When wounded and infuriated
with pain, many of them become literally savage[1]; but, so unaccustomed
are they to act as assailants, and so awkward and inexpert in using
their strength, that they rarely or ever exceed in killing a pursuer
who falls into their power.

Although the pressure of a foot, a blow with the trunk, or a thrust with the tusk, could scarcely
fail to prove fatal, three-fourths of those who have fallen into their power have escaped without
serious injury. So great is this chance of impunity, that the sportsman prefers to approach within
about fifteen paces of the advancing elephant, a space which gives time for a second fire should
the first shot prove ineffectual, and should both fail there is still opportunity for flight.

[Footnote
1: Some years ago an elephant which had been wounded by a native, near Hambangtotte, pursued the
man into the town, followed him along the street, trampled him to death in the bazaar before
a crowd of spectators, and succeeded in making good its retreat to the jungle.]

Amongst full-grown timber, a skilful runner can escape from an elephant by ""dodging"" round the trees,
but in cleared land, and low brushwood, the difficulty is much increased,
as the small growth of underwood which obstructs the movements of
man presents no obstacle to those of an elephant.

On the other hand, on level and open ground the chances are rather in favour of the elephant,
as his pace in full flight exceeds that of man, although as a general rule, it is unequal to
that of a horse, as has been sometimes asserted.[1]

[Footnote 1: SHAW, in his Zoology, asserts that an elephant can run as swiftly as a horse can
gallop. London, 1800-6, vol. i. p. 216.]

The incessant slaughter of elephants by sportsmen in Ceylon, appears to be merely in subordination
to the influence of the organ of destructiveness, since the carcase is never applied to any
useful purpose, but left to decompose and to defile the air of the forest. The flesh is occasionally
tasted as a matter of curiosity: as a steak it is coarse and tough; but the tongue is as delicate
as that of an ox; and the foot is said to make palatable soup. The Caffres attached to the pioneer
corps in the Kandyan province are in the habit of securing the heart of any elephant shot in their
vicinity, and say it is their custom to eat it in Africa.

The hide it has been found impracticable to tan in Ceylon, or to convert to any useful purpose, but
the bones of those shot have of late years been collected and used for manuring coffee estates.
The hair of the tail, which is extremely strong and horny, is mounted by the native goldsmith, and
made into bracelets; and the teeth are sawn by the Moormen at Galle (as they used to be by
the Romans during a scarcity of ivory) into plates, out of which they fashion numerous articles
of ornament, knife-handles, card racks, and ""presse-papiers.""

NOTE.

Amongst extraordinary recoveries from desperate wounds, I venture to record here an instance
which occurred in Ceylon to a gentleman while engaged in the chase of elephants, and which, I
apprehend, has few parallels in pathological experience. Lieutenant GERARD FRETZ, of the Ceylon
Rifle Regiment, whilst firing at an elephant in the vicinity of Fort MacDonald, in Oovah, was
wounded in the face by the bursting of his fowling-piece, on the 22nd January, 1828. He was then
about thirty-two years of age.

On raising him, it was found that part of the breech of the gun and about two inches of the barrel
had been driven through the frontal sinus, at the junction of the nose and forehead. It had
sunk almost perpendicularly till the iron-plate called ""the tail-pin,"" by which the barrel is
made fast to the stock by a screw, had descended through the palate,
carrying with it the screw, one extremity of which had forced itself
into the right nostril, where it was discernible externally, whilst
the headed end lay in contact with his tongue.

To extract the jagged mass of iron thus sunk in the ethmoidal and sphenoidal cells was found
hopelessly impracticable; but, strange to tell, after the inflammation subsided, Mr. FRETZ recovered
rapidly; his general health was unimpaired, and he returned to his regiment with this, singular
appendage firmly embedded behind the bones of his face. He took his turn of duty as usual, attained
the command of his company, participated in all the enjoyments of the mess-room, and died
eight years afterwards, on the 1st of April, 1836, not from any consequences of this fearful wound,
but from fever and inflammation brought on by other causes.

So little was he apparently inconvenienced by the presence of the strange body in his palate that
he was accustomed with his finger partially to undo the screw, which but for its extreme length
he might altogether have withdrawn. To enable this to be done, and possibly to assist by this
means the extraction of the breech itself through the original orifice (which never entirely
closed), an attempt was made in 1835 to take off a portion of the screw with a file; but, after
having cut it three parts through the operation was interrupted, chiefly owing to the carelessness
and indifference of Capt. FRETZ, whose death occurred before the
attempt could be resumed.

The piece of iron, on being removed after his decease, was found to measure 2-3/4 inches in length,
and weighed two scruples more than two ounces and three quarters. A cast of the breech and screw
now forms No. 2790 amongst the deposits in the Medical Museum of Chatham.

CHAP. V.

THE ELEPHANT.

* * * * *

An Elephant Corral.

So long as the elephants of Ceylon were merely required in small numbers for the pageantry of
the native princes, or the sacred processions of the Buddhist temples, their capture was effected
either by the instrumentality of female decoys, or by the artifices and agility of the individuals
and castes who devoted themselves to their pursuit and training. But after the arrival of the European
conquerors of the island, and when it had become expedient to take advantage of the strength
and intelligence of these creatures in clearing forests and making
roads and other works, establishments were organised on a great scale
by the Portuguese and Dutch, and the supply of elephants kept up by
periodical battues conducted at the cost of the government, on a plan
similar to that adopted on the continent of India, when herds varying
in number from twenty to one hundred and upwards are driven into concealed
enclosures and secured.

In both these processes, success is entirely dependent on the skill with which the captors turn
to advantage the terror and inexperience of the wild elephant, since all attempts would be futile
to subdue or confine by ordinary force an animal of such strength and sagacity.[1]

[Footnote 1: The device of taking them by means of pitfalls still prevails in India: but in addition
to the difficulty of providing against that caution with which the elephant is supposed to reconnoitre
suspicious ground, it has the further disadvantage of exposing him to injury from bruises and
dislocations in his fall. Still it was the mode of capture employed by the Singhalese, and so late as
1750 WOLF relates that the native chiefs of the Wanny, when capturing
elephants for the Dutch, made ""pits some fathoms deep in those places
whither the elephant is wont to go in search of food, across which
were laid poles covered with branches and baited with the food of
which he is fondest, making towards which he finds himself taken unawares.

Thereafter being subdued by fright and exhaustion, he was assisted to raise himself to the surface
by means of hurdles and earth, which he placed underfoot as they were thrown down to him, till
he was enabled to step out on solid ground, when the noosers and decoys were in readiness to tie
him up to the nearest tree.""--See WOLF'S Life and Adventures, p. 152. Shakspeare appears to have
been acquainted with the plan of taking elephants in pitfalls: Decius, encouraging the conspirators,
reminds them of Cæsar's taste for anecdotes of animals, by which he would undertake to lure him
to his fate:

""For he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees. And bears with glasses; elephants
with holes.""

JULIUS CÆSAR, Act ii. Scene I.]

Knox describes with circumstantiality the mode adopted, two centuries
ago, by the servants of the King of Kandy to catch elephants for the
royal stud.

He says, ""After discovering the retreat of such as have tusks, unto these they drive some she
elephants, which they bring with them for the purpose, which, when once the males have got a sight
of, they will never leave, but follow them wheresoever they go; and the females are so used
to it that they will do whatsoever, either by word or a beck, their keepers bid them. And so they
delude them along through towns and countries, and through the streets of the city, even to the very
gates of the king's palace, where sometimes they seize upon them by snares, and sometimes by
driving them into a kind of pound, they catch them.""[1]

[Footnote 1: KNOX'S Historical Relation of Ceylon, A.D. 1681, part i. ch. vi. p. 21.]

In Nepaul and Burmah, and throughout the Chin-Indian Peninsula, when in pursuit of single elephants,
either rogues detached from the herd, or individuals who have been marked for the beauty of their
ivory, the natives avail themselves of the aid of females in order to effect their approaches
and secure an opportunity of casting a noose over the foot of the destined captive. All accounts
concur in expressing high admiration of their courage and address; but from what has fallen under
my own observation, added to the descriptions I have heard from other eye-witnesses, I am inclined
to believe that in such exploits the Moormen of Ceylon evince a daring and adroitness, surpassing
all others.

These professional elephant catchers, or, as they are called, Panickeas, inhabit the Moorish
villages in the north and north-east of the island, and from time immemorial have been engaged
in taking elephants, which are afterwards trained by Arabs, chiefly for the use of the rajahs
and native princes in the south of India, whose vakeels are periodically despatched to make
purchases in Ceylon.

The ability evinced by these men in tracing elephants through the woods has almost the certainty
of instinct; and hence their services are eagerly sought by the European sportsmen who go down
into their country in search of game. So keen is their glance, that like hounds running ""breast high""
they will follow the course of an elephant, almost at the top of their speed, over glades covered with
stunted grass, where the eye of a stranger would fail to discover
a trace of its passage, and on through forests strewn with dry leaves,
where it seems impossible to perceive a footstep.

Here they are guided by a bent or broken twig, or by a leaf dropped from the animal's mouth, on
which the pressure of a tooth may be detected. If at fault, they fetch a circuit like a setter,
till lighting on some fresh marks, they go a-head again with renewed vigour. So delicate is the
sense of smell in the elephant, and so indispensable is it to go against the wind in approaching
him, that on those occasions when the wind is so still that its direction cannot be otherwise
discerned, the Panickeas will suspend the film of a gossamer to determine it and shape their course
accordingly.

They are enabled by the inspection of the footmarks, when impressed in soft clay, to describe
the size as well as the number of a herd before it is seen; the height of an elephant at the
shoulder being as nearly as possible twice the circumference of his fore foot.[1]

On overtaking the game their courage is as conspicuous as their sagacity. If they have confidence
in the sportsman for whom they are finding, they will advance to
the very heel of the elephant, slap him on the quarter, and convert
his timidity into anger, till he turns upon his tormentor and exposes
his front to receive the bullet which is awaiting him.[2]

[Footnote
1: Previous to the death of the female elephant in the Zoological
Gardens, in the Regent's Park, in 1851, Mr. MITCHELL, the Secretary,
caused measurements to be accurately made, and found the statement
of the Singhalese hunters to be strictly correct, the height at the
shoulders being precisely twice the circumference of the fore foot.]

[Footnote
2: Major SKINNER, the Chief Officer at the head of the Commission
of Roads, in Ceylon, in writing to me, mentions an anecdote illustrative
of the daring of the Panickeas.

""I once saw,"" he says, ""a very beautiful example of the confidence with which these fellows,
from their knowledge of the elephants, meet their worst defiance. It was in Neuera-Kalawa;
I was bivouacking on the bank of a river, and had been kept out so late that I did not get
to my tent until between 9 and 10 at night. On our return towards it we passed several single
elephants making their way to the nearest water, but at length we came upon a large herd that
had taken possession of the only road by which we could pass, and which no intimidation would
induce to move off. I had some Panickeas with me; they knew the herd, and counselled extreme caution.
After trying every device we could think of for a length of time, a little old Moorman of the
party came to me and requested we should all retire to a distance.

He then took a couple of chules (flambeaux of dried wood, or coco-nut
leaves), one in each hand, and waving them above his head till they
flamed out fiercely, he advanced at a deliberate pace to within a
few yards of the elephant who was acting as leader of the party, and
who was growling and trumpeting in his rage, and flourished the flaming
torches in his face.

The effect was instantaneous: the whole herd dashed away in a panic,
bellowing, screaming, and crushing through the underwood, whilst we
availed ourselves of the open path to make our way to our tents.""]

So
fearless and confident are they that two men, without aid or attendants,
will boldly attempt to capture the largest-sized elephant.

Their only weapon is a flexible rope made of elk's or buffalo's hide,
with which it is their object to secure one of the hind legs.

This they effect either by following in its footsteps when in motion or by stealing close up to
it when at rest, and availing themselves of its well-known propensity at such moments to swing
the feet backwards and forwards, they contrive to slip a noose over the hind leg.

At other times this is achieved by spreading the noose on the ground partially concealed by
roots and leaves beneath a tree on which one of the party is stationed, whose business it is
to lift it suddenly by means of a cord, raising it on the elephant's leg at the moment when
his companion has succeeded in provoking him to place his foot within the circle, the other end
having been previously made fast to the stem of the tree.
 What their fathers, husbands, or brothers told them, they might
believe if they chose; for the rest, to the very large majority of women, history was a sealed
book; so that, for want of correct information, they were not in a position to contradict any
assertion, however extravagant, untruthful, or absurd it might be.

In the foregoing pages of this treatise, it has been maintained that the statements concerning
the alleged mental inferiority of women are untruthful; and that history, both ancient and
modern, proves them to be so. In order, therefore, to establish this proposition more fully,
the following sketches have been added, giving an account of a few women eminent for the founding
of colonies, for piety, for patriotism, and for attainments in science, literature, and arts;
and some, alas! for wickedness.

ELISA, OR DIDO, FOUNDER OF CARTHAGE.

Carthage, one of the most noted nations of antiquity, was founded by a woman, and flourished
under her rule. A Tyrian princess, Dido--or Elisa, as she is indiscriminately named in history--was
in jeopardy from the tyranny and oppression of an unnatural brother, who, not content with
what he had inherited from his father, had cast covetous eyes upon the immense possessions
of his sister's husband, whose death he compassed. All the powers of mind which had hitherto
lain dormant within her, being roused by the horrid act of her brother, Dido at once set about
rescuing her treasure from his grasp, and her retainers from his unbridled fury. Not choosing
to seek protection from any of the princes of the surrounding countries, and knowing herself
to be unsafe while in the vicinity of her brother, she, as speedily as possible, and with the
utmost secresy, gathered what she was possessed of together, and, with her followers, embarked
in search of some country where she might live free from tyranny and oppression. Undaunted
by the dangers, real and imaginary, which beset the paths of the early navigators of the Mediterranean,
the little band of adventurers pursued their course, steering westward, ever westward; away
past Egypt, and past Libya, until they came in sight of a peninsula on the northern coast of
Africa hitherto unknown to history, but ever afterward to be famous as the landing-place of
the heroic woman. At a point only a short distance from the site of the present city of Tunis,
Dido, with her followers, established herself; not taking possession of the territory on which
she set her foot, as became the fashion some time later, but purchasing it from the natives
at a given price. According to the usage of the times, she at once set about founding a city;
and one hundred years before the founding of Rome--its after rival and destroyer--the work
of building Carthage, or the New City, as Dido named it, began. The city being advantageously
situated for commerce, and the rule of Dido more mild than that of Pygmalion, her brother,
hundreds of the Tyrians flocked to her standard. These men of Tyre brought with them their
old home-love of commercial enterprise and maritime adventure; and, in a marvelously short
time, Carthage took high rank among the nations of the world; and it was conceded, by one of
the most renowned philosophers of Greece, that it enjoyed one of the most perfect governments
of antiquity.

It is told of Dido, that she was not only capable and brave, but also--like many of the opposite
sex--somewhat sharp in a bargain; and that she tricked the Africans into giving her more territory
than they designed doing. The story is--though it is not generally believed--that having bargained
with the natives for as much land as an ox-hide would encompass, she cut it up into the smallest
possible strips, and by this means made it capable of surrounding a large extent of ground;
and, as a bargain is a bargain, she gained possession of the inclosure by agreeing to pay an
annual tribute for it. But whether or not this rather improbable story be true, avarice and
tyranny on the part of a brother seems to have roused the dormant power in Dido's nature; and
the indomitable perseverance, fortitude, and faculty for government displayed by the outraged
woman, were the forces which brought about the founding of a powerful nation. King Pygmalion
is only remembered because he was the brother of the illustrious Queen Dido.

CLEOPATRA.

The character of Cleopatra forms a striking contrast to that of Dido, in many particulars:
the one the first princess and founder of a nation destined to live in history ages after it
had ceased to exist; the other the last princess of a land equally famed in story, whose kingdom
was to suffer extinction, in a great measure in consequence of her vices--not because she was
too weak to sway the scepter, but because she was too wicked to rule justly.

The last representative of the dynasty of the Ptolemies, she seemed to possess an undue share
of the evil propensities of an evil race; and, with this, the gift of rare beauty, added to
very winning manners and remarkable powers of fascination. In her constitution was blended
a dangerous combination of varied charms and varied vices. The learning of the Egyptian schools
she had mastered; there were none of the then modern accomplishments of which she had not made
herself mistress; wealth and regal honors were hers; and yet what a sad picture she presents!
Evil passions were allowed to rankle in her breast unchecked, till she became one of the vilest
creatures, in a country become the vilest and basest of nations. The powers of mind with which
she was endowed, used for the benefit of her country, might have been the means of its salvation;
but instead of appealing to the patriotism of her people--if, indeed, they then possessed any--she
chose rather to court the favor of the rising Roman general, and gain by flattery and crime
what might have been denied to virtue. Though her kingdom was in danger, and her own position
and the inheritance of her children were at stake, she reveled in sinful pleasure with the
enemy. By the power of her charms, she effected a compromise with the first Caesar, which left
her in possession of Egypt; but not on honorable terms. How could terms, dictated on the one
side and agreed to on the other by base passion, be aught but shameful and humiliating?

Caesar in the west, and the Roman legions far away, Cleopatra paid no more regard to the treaty
between them than if it had never been made. Such a violation of contract the Romans never
forgave; and Mark Antony, who had striven to rise to the supreme power after the assassination
of Julius Caesar, as soon as he had leisure from his other ambitious schemes, bent his steps
toward Egypt, to punish the faithless queen. Again she had recourse to her personal charms.
The stern but vicious general, though in name a conqueror, became an easy victim of her wiles;
and was himself in fact the conquered one. If Cleopatra had been Mark Antony's most bitter
foe, she could not more surely have lured him on to utter, hopeless ruin.

At last, the crisis came. Augustus Caesar had arrived upon the shores of Egypt to avenge his
sister's wrongs. Mark Antony's fate was sealed. Once more the wretched woman tried her powers
of fascination; but youth and sprightliness were gone. She failed to captivate Augustus by
her winning manners, or move him by a display of her distress. Her power, she realized at last,
was gone; but grace his triumph in Rome she was determined she would not. As a crowned queen
she had lived; as one she would die. The deadly asp, it is said, became the executioner of
her wicked will; and when the victor came to stay the act which would rob him of a part of
his revenge, he found the work accomplished. Cleopatra would try her wiles no more.

Here was a woman who, by her adroitness and tact and a passionate will, wielded an almost incredible
power over some of the greatest men of that age; whom she brought under her influence, and
for years led them whither she would, according to the whim which possessed her. Which was
the weaker mentally, Mark Antony or Cleopatra? It is for the historical student to determine
for himself. In licentiousness, they certainly were on a par.

LUCRETIA.

Contrast the depravity of the wretched Cleopatra with the virtue of Lucretia, wife of Collatinus,
a distinguished Roman. Beautiful and, for the time in which she lived, highly accomplished,
she was the idol of her husband. Loving and faithful to him, and attentive to the ordering
of her household, she was pronounced a model Roman dame. Virtue was pre-eminently a characteristic
of the Roman matron. A heartless libertine, annoyed that Lucretia should stand so high, and
fired by wine and evil passion, determined to accomplish her downfall; and, while she was helplessly
in his power, effected his vile purpose. The outraged woman waited till her husband and father
could be summoned; and, having told her dreadful tale, and entreated them to avenge her dishonor,
she plunged a dagger to her heart. A heathen, she knew not there was sin in suicide, and preferred
death to a tarnished reputation.

PORTIA.

Like Lucretia, Portia was a Roman matron of noble lineage, and still nobler powers of mind.
The daughter of Cato and wife of Brutus, it was her ambition to prove herself worthy of such
a sire and such a husband; and, after the pagan fashion of the time, she subjected herself
to an exceedingly painful physical ordeal, in order to test her powers of endurance. Having
established the fact beyond a doubt that she was fully equal to her husband in fortitude and
strength of character, she became his confidant and counselor, sharing his trials and misfortunes
as readily as she had shared his prosperity. The ambition of Brutus, together with the jealous
rivalries of the time, effected his ruin; and, finding his case hopelessly desperate, he caused
himself to be mortally wounded, and expired shortly after. Portia had been so fondly attached
to her husband that her friends feared she would determine not to survive him, and in consequence
took measures to prevent her from taking her own life; but she foiled all their prudent forethought
by swallowing a handful of live coals. Faithful to her husband to the last, according to her
idea of fidelity, one can but lament that she had not the knowledge of a purer faith than that
of paganism. She was worthy of a better fate and brighter age.

ZENOBIA.

Lucretia and Portia adorned private life, and--except in the manner of their respective deaths--were
model matrons, the equals of their husbands in integrity and understanding. Zenobia takes a
somewhat higher rank; though no more virtuous--that being impossible--she was called to exercise
her talents in a different sphere. Though born in Asia, she claimed descent from the Macedonian
kings of Egypt. In her youth, notwithstanding the restraints put upon her sex, she acquired
a liberal education, and made herself mistress of the Latin, Greek, Egyptian, and Syriac literature.

She took an active part in the promotion of learning, and even compiled an epitome of Oriental
history for her own use. Palmyra, ""the gem of the desert,"" was favored in possessing such a
princess. As beautiful as she was accomplished, she might in these respects be compared to
her famous ancestress, Cleopatra; but here the resemblance ended. She was as famous for her
virtues as was Cleopatra for her vices.

Arrived at maturity, she united her destiny with that of Odenathus, a man who had risen from
an obscure position to the highest rank in the land. An intrepid general, he had not only subdued
the neighboring tribes of the desert, but had, in a measure, humbled the haughty Persian king,
and avenged the cruelty practiced upon the unfortunate Valerian, which the dissensions among
the Romans prevented them from doing themselves, and had made himself master of the dominion
of the East. In Zenobia he found a true helpmeet. She inured herself to hardships in order
that she might accompany her husband in his hazardous undertakings, and assist him by her counsels
or cheer him by her presence. To her prudence and fortitude Odenathus owed much of his success,
both as a general and a monarch; so that in a few years, from the small possessions adjoining
Palmyra, he had extended his territory from the Euphrates to the frontiers of Bithynia. During
the intervals between the wars in which he engaged from time to time, he spent much of his
leisure in hunting or other wild sports; and in these active amusements his wife also accompanied
him. She even marched, when the occasion required it, at the head of their troops. For years
every thing went prosperously; then Odenathus was snatched away by death, and the entire responsibility
of the Government devolved upon Zenobia alone. The Romans, now grown stronger than they had
been for some time after the defeat of Valerian, disputed the right of the widow of Odenathus
to assume the reins of government, and sent out generals to compel her to submit to the dictum
of the Senate. One of these she met, and obliged to retreat with the loss of his army, his
mortification at defeat being increased by the fact that he had been beaten by a woman.

By judicious tact, she attached both her subjects and her soldiers to her cause, and enlarged
the borders of her dominion very considerably. Even Egypt yielded to her prowess, and haughty
Persia solicited an alliance with her. She was, in fact, as powerful as any of the Eastern
potentates, if not the most powerful. No petty passion or malice was allowed to mark her conduct
in the treatment of her subjects. The good of her country was her principal object in government,
and for the good of the State she would forgive, or at least not punish, a personal injury.
And, though surrounding herself with all the splendors of royalty, she yet managed the financial
affairs of her realm with economy.

But the prosperity of her kingdom, and her own success as a sovereign, only increased the envy
and resentment of the Romans. Aurelian had gained the supreme power in Rome, and, once established
in his authority, he determined to make good the old boast--once so true--that Rome was mistress
of the world. Zenobia was a powerful rival, and her he determined to humble. Finding her kingdom
menaced by so powerful a foe, she set herself to defend it, and met the approaching enemy a
hundred miles from her capital. Here the tide of fortune turned against the hitherto prosperous
queen. In two successive battles she suffered defeat, and then she shut herself up in Palmyra,
hoping to starve Aurelian into leaving her in peace; but his star was yet in the ascendant,
the last obstacle was overcome, and Palmyra fell.

Zenobia, with some of her attendants, fled; but was overtaken and brought back a prisoner,
destined to grace the triumph of her conqueror. She who had for more than five years ruled
a powerful nation so nobly and so well, was henceforth to be subjected to the indignities of
a captive.

With Zenobia, fell the dominion of the East, and its once beautiful capital dwindled into insignificance.

HYPATIA.

Rather more than a century had passed since the subjugation of Zenobia and her Empire by pagan
Rome, when Hypatia, the philosopher of Alexandria, attracted the attention of the then civilized
world by her marvelous talents and varied accomplishments. The daughter of Theon, the celebrated
mathematician of Alexandria, she possessed unusual facilities--for a woman--for acquiring knowledge;
and especially for becoming acquainted with the abstruse sciences. Of these facilities she
availed herself with commendable earnestness; and at an early age she had made herself mistress
of both Geometry and Astronomy, as far as either science was then understood or taught in any
of the schools. As is the case with less profound natures, the mind grew on what it fed upon;
reasoning, and the elucidation of knotty mathematical problems, became her delight; and, by
general consent, she ranked as one of the first philosophers of her time, if not indeed the
very first.

It has often been asserted that the possession of great mental power unfits the woman possessing
it for the common amenities of life. That it does not necessarily do any thing of the kind,
is sufficiently evidenced in the life of Hypatia. Though elevated to the very pinnacle of fame,
in consequence of her mental attainments, she was nevertheless gentle and courteous in her
manners, toward those by whom she was surrounded. She was very beautiful, yet without vanity;
indeed, true strength of mind precludes the idea of vanity, for few but the mentally weak are
vain; and she was as chaste as she was mentally strong and physically beautiful.

Convinced of her superior merits, the authorities of the School of Philosophy in which Plotinus
and his successors had expounded their theories, importuned her to become preceptress therein;
and, overcoming her natural diffidence, she consented. Thenceforth, instead of the frivolous
adornments, considered too foolish to be worn by men, but quite fitting and becoming for women,
she was arrayed in the cloak of the philosopher, and took her proper position as head of the
most noted school in a city distinguished as the chief seat of learning of that age. As a public
speaker--for her lectures were not altogether confined to her school--she was fluent. Her elocution
may be said to have been faultless, and her manner of address pleasing; and these, combined
with the very remarkable amount of information which she was capable of conveying in her lectures,
drew crowds of warm admirers and enthusiastically devoted students to listen to her.

Was it possible that one so gifted, so beautiful and pure, could arouse malicious envy, or
make an enemy by the exercise of talents God had given her?

Ah, yes! She knew more than Cyril--a professedly Christian bishop, who then filled the patriarchal
chair. Thenceforth she was marked as his prey.

Allied to the State, the Church had lost its purity, and become the bitterest of persecutors;
and Cyril was one of the bitterest of these. The Jews had enjoyed a degree of liberty in Alexandria,
which latterly had been denied them elsewhere; and this the haughty spirit of the arrogant
bishop could not brook; and, assuming that his power as an ecclesiastic was in consequence
superior to the civil authority, he, after treating the Jews with most outrageous cruelty,
banished them from the city. The Jews had been allowed to inhabit Alexandria from the time
of its foundation, and had materially contributed to its prosperity; therefore, the civil authorities
were not willing to see them suffer such indignities without raising their voice against the
oppressive act. Orestes, Prefect of the city, appealed to the emperor on their behalf. He,
trammeled with his Church connections, and yet not wishing to break with the prefect, declined
to interfere in the matter, thus leaving them to settle the dispute by themselves; and soon
the ecclesiastics and the citizens joined issue. Orestes, being attacked by a party of monks
as he was peaceably pursuing his way through the streets in his carriage, was succored by the
citizens, who came to his relief; and in the affray a monk was taken prisoner, whom the justly
exasperated Orestes ordered to be executed. The sentence was carried into effect, and Cyril
caused the name of the would-be murderer to be enrolled among the martyrs.

Hypatia was neither Jew nor Christian; but her love of truth and justice caused her to espouse
the side of the persecuted victims of ecclesiastical tyranny. She had previously been the object
of Cyril's bitter hatred, because her mental attainments were superior to his own. Now, that
hatred was intensified to the highest degree of malignity. She had openly and boldly censured
the conduct of the bishop, and was deemed the friend of Orestes; therefore she must die. Having
committed no crime, she could not be brought before the civil tribunal for condemnation; therefore,
as her death had been determined upon, murder was the next resort.

She was surrounded and seized by a mob in the interest of Cyril, as she was one day returning
from her school, and hurried into the Caesarian church, where she was brutally murdered, every
barbarity being practiced upon her which monks were capable of inventing, even to tearing her
limb from limb, and afterward burning her; and Cyril, if indeed he did not sanction the murder
by his actual presence while it was being committed, sanctioned the horrid deed by his protection
of the perpetrators when the infuriated populace would have avenged her death.

Thus tragic was the end of one of the most highly gifted women the world has ever produced.
She flourished in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius II, in the early part of the fifth century.

The record of the Famous Women of Antiquity might be lengthened out indefinitely: Cornelia,
the mother of the Gracchi, so famous in Roman history; Octavia, the deeply injured wife of
Mark Antony; Eudosia, the wife of Theodosius, with her equally famous sister-in-law, Pulcheria;
the Aspasia of Pericles, who is represented by some writers as having composed many of the
orations given to the world as those of her husband; the Aspasia of Cyrus, so famous for her
gentle modesty and wise counsels; and Marianne, the last and most unfortunate princess of the
illustrious line of the Maccabees, and wife of the monster, Herod the Great. Each of these,
to do justice to their merits, or to the transactions which rendered them famous, would require
a biography. The mere mention of their names must suffice just here. Who has not read or heard
of Sappho, the Greek poetess, concerning whose life and moral character there has been so much
controversy--one class of writers condemning in unstinted measure, as all and utterly vile;
the other class applauding her as being possessed of every virtue? Says one of the latter:
""In Sappho, a warm and profound sensibility, virgin purity, feminine softness, and delicacy
of sentiment and feeling, were combined with the native probity and simplicity of the Eolian
character; and, although endued with a fine perception of the beautiful and brilliant, she
preferred genuine conscious rectitude to every other source of human enjoyment."" It is probable
a medium between these two extremes would give the true character of this remarkable woman.

Many scores of names, besides those given, might be added to the list of eminent women; but
the examples cited suffice to prove the assertion made--so far as the women of antiquity are
concerned--that they were capable of an equal amount of mental effort with the men with whom
they were contemporary; and that, where they arose to the supreme power, they governed as wisely
and as well as the kings of the same period.

CHAPTER IX.

Eminent Women of Modern Times.

It now remains to be seen whether the women of modern times have been worthy of note, or what
they have in any way accomplished.

COUNTESS OF MONTFORT.

In the troublous times about the middle of the fourteenth century, when every petty prince
in Europe was trying to overreach his immediate neighbor and grasp his lands, and when ties
of blood seemed only to intensify feuds, there arose two claimants for the principality of
Brittany. The Count of Montfort, half-brother of the last duke, and Charles of Blois, were
the rivals; and each prosecuted his claim with vigor. The army of Charles laid siege to Nantz,
in which Montfort happened to be, and from which he found it impossible to escape.

Here was a dilemma. The partisans of Montfort were without an efficient leader; and his chances
of gaining what he claimed were exceedingly doubtful. In this crisis of his affairs, however,
an unexpected diversion was made, which changed the current of fortune. His wife, Jane of Flanders,
now Countess of Montfort, had hitherto limited her administrative abilities to the careful
management of her domestic concerns; and, it is to be supposed, was not deemed capable of a
thought beyond. The tidings of the virtual captivity of her husband roused in her a determination
to defend what she considered to be his rights, since he was unable to defend them himself.

She was at the time residing at Rennes, the inhabitants of which she caused to be assembled,
and made known the disaster which had befallen their sovereign. Her infant son she presented
before them as the last of an illustrious line, which must become extinct unless his father's
fortunes were retrieved; and she besought them to prove now, by actions, the attachment they
had formerly professed for the count. Nor was her address in vain. The citizens, inspired by
courage and eloquence, vowed they would fight under her standard alone, and live or die with
her. The garrisons throughout Brittany followed the example of Rennes, and she found herself
at the head of a respectable army; but, fearing that she was not sufficiently strong to cope
with Charles, who was backed by the strength of France, she applied to Edward III, of England,
for help. Then, having put the affairs of the province in the best possible position, she established
herself at Hennebonne, where she awaited the issue of events; having first sent her son to
England, that he might be out of danger.

In the mean time, Charles of Blois was not inactive. Hennebonne was, of itself, too important
a fortress to be overlooked; and, besides that, the heroic countess was there. If he could
take the city and make prisoner its defender, his cause would be gained. With both the count
and his wife in his power, he would be sure of the succession. Accordingly, before the supplies
which Edward was sending could reach Hennebonne, he laid siege to it; but did not find its
capture so easy a matter as he had expected.

The besieged made frequent sallies, in which the enemy lost both men and reputation, though
they were not compelled to raise the siege. On one of these occasions the return of the countess
was intercepted, and she found it impossible to regain the fortress. Nothing daunted she commanded
her men to disperse themselves over the country, while she made her own escape to Brest. As
soon as was possible, she collected another and larger force, and, forcing her way through
the enemy's camp, made good her entrance into the city, to the great joy of her almost discouraged
partisans.

Subsequently, the re-enforcements expected from Edward not having yet arrived, it was thought
the garrison would be obliged to capitulate, and negotiations were actually commenced. The
countess, deeply mortified at the turn her affairs were taking, had mounted a high turret,
and there remained, looking sadly out over the sea in the direction whence the long-expected,
but now despaired of, supplies should have come. Perhaps there was still a slight hope in her
heart that, even yet, the desired aid might be afforded. If so, that hope was destined to be
realized. As she kept her position, gazing sorrowfully over the wide expanse of waters, she
descried dark objects on the very verge of the horizon. The despairing look gave place to one
of eager, hopeful watching. The objects increased in size as she strained the eye to determine
what they really were. A favorable breeze was wafting them nearer, and presently they took
a tangible form. ""Sails! sails!"" cried the delighted countess. ""Behold the succors--the English
succors. No capitulation!"" The opportune arrival of the re-enforcements sent by Edward had
saved the garrison. Charles was obliged to raise the siege. He had neither taken the city nor
captured the countess.

Edward's six thousand gallant troops did the cause of the countess and her still besieged husband
good service. They had not appeared upon the field at an earlier period in the struggle in
consequence of contrary winds. But the delay itself had accomplished very much in bringing
out the strong points in the character of the countess. She had proved to the world that she
could not only collect an army, but do even more--efficiently command it.

Subsequently, the cause of Charles of Blois seemed to gain fresh strength, and his party greatly
outnumbered that of Montfort, whose friends decreased as those of Charles increased. Edward
again sent re-enforcements. The English fleet, having with them the countess, were met on the
passage to Brittany by the enemy, and an action ensued, in which the countess behaved with
the utmost courage, charging the foe as valorously as any other officer among them. A storm
put an end to the bloody conflict, and the fleet, without further adventure, reached the shores
of Brittany. Thenceforth the dispute of the succession became inextricably mixed up in the
quarrel between England and France, becoming indeed a part of it; and we trace the career of
the heroic Countess of Montfort no further.

ANNE ASKEW.

In the preceding sketch, it has been shown what a woman could--did, in fact--do and dare, as
an ardent patriot and loving wife. The fortitude of Anne Askew was of a different stamp. She
proved what she could endure for conscience' sake. The Reformation produced many women such
as she; but her simple story must suffice, here, for all.

She was a young lady of high family, and exercised a remarkable influence, for one so young,
over the ladies at the Court of Henry VIII; and even stood in the relation of a friend to the
queen--no great passport to the favor of the monster Henry. Being possessed of considerable
mental ability, she gave much of her attention to the study of the theological questions which
were disturbing the peace of Europe at the time; and being also of an independent turn, and
withal deeply pious, she dared to question Henry's dogma concerning the ""real presence"" of
the body of Christ in the Sacrament. Henry was furious that a woman should dare to hold any
tenet other than he allowed, or dispute one which he had decreed must be believed. The infamous
Bonner was commissioned to confer with her respecting her religious views; and, finding her
firm in her determination not to yield to either his dictates or those of the king, he pronounced
her a heretic. His conduct in representing her as such was the more reprehensible, as, while
refusing to give entire credence to the doctrine they wished to impose upon her, she told the
bishop and wrote to the king that, ""As to the Lord's-supper, she believed as much as Christ
himself had said of it, ... and as much as the Catholic Church required.""

But the king, though professing to be a reformer, would brook nothing which did not accord
precisely with his own dogmatic utterances. Her presuming to write to him, when she did not
submit to his dictation, he chose to construe as a fresh insult to himself.

Her youth (she was but seventeen), her beauty, and her innocence were no protection. The rack,
and then the stake, were all that remained, unless she could be prevailed on to recant. This
she gently but firmly refused to do.

The king was determined to root out the heresy--if it existed there--from the court; and those
who knew him, knew that there was no cruelty of which he would not be guilty to accomplish
his end. Wriothesley, the chancellor, waited on the unfortunate Miss Askew to examine her concerning
the religious sentiments of the other ladies of the court; but, though bold in professing her
own religious views, she was just as firm in refusing to implicate any of her former associates.
Threatenings and promises were alike found useless. Then she was subjected to the most excruciating
torture; but, though every limb was dislocated, the noble girl remained true to her friends
and to her God. So enraged was the chancellor at her fortitude, that when the lieutenant of
the tower refused to obey his order to screw the rack still more tightly, he seized the instrument
himself, and wrenched it so violently as almost to tear the ""body asunder."" But her constancy
was unshaken. Torture having failed, the poor, mangled body was thrust into a chair, and carried
to the stake. A Catholic priest and two other persons were conducted with her to execution,
all condemned in like manner for the violation of the king's mandates. Bound to their respective
stakes, these victims of intolerant bigotry and unlimited tyranny awaited with patience the
kindling of the fagots which were piled around. But they were to be still further tempted ere
they were released from suffering. While they were thus publicly exposed in the most painful
of positions, suffering all the physical agony it was possible to endure and live, a message
was sent to them that, if they would even at that late period recant, their lives would be
spared. But they refused to purchase life at such a price, and calmly met their doom, Miss
Askew with as much fortitude as either of the others.

Thus, amid smoke and flame, the pure spirit of Anne Askew was wafted, by attendant angels,
to the paradise of God, whom she was not ashamed to honor before men. In all the struggle of
the Reformation, what man exhibited more courage or greater strength of character or fortitude
than this beautiful girl of but seventeen Summers? In what respect did she exhibit inferiority
to those men associated with her in the trying year (1546) in which she earned her crown of
martyrdom? There were many martyrs, but not one more steadfast.

ESTHER INGLIS.

The reign of Elizabeth has been styled the Augustine age of England. Under this queen's sanction,
literature flourished more than ever before in that kingdom; and as a consequence her people
became less barbarous, and men learned to look with less admiration upon the sword, and more
respect on books. The influence of the encouragement given to men of letters by Elizabeth tells
for good upon our literature, even after this lapse of time.

Among the personages eminent in this reign was Esther Inglis, who was exceedingly zealous,
and industrious withal, in translating and transcribing the Scriptures into various languages,
particularly French and Latin. Copies of these she presented to persons of distinction, one
of which--a copy of the Psalms, and a rare specimen of calligraphy--she presented to the queen,
who graciously accepted it, and subsequently had it deposited in the library of Christ's Church,
Oxford.

She was pronounced by the most exacting critics to be the most accurate chirographist that
had been known up to that period; nor has her peer been found since. She excelled even the
celebrated Ascham and Davies, both in the number and variety of styles. Her copy of the Book
of Proverbs is perhaps her most elaborate work of art, and is a marvel for the ingenious combination
of writing, of which there are forty specimens, and fine pen-and-ink drawings. Every chapter,
which is embellished both at the beginning and end with beautiful decorations, is written in
a different hand, and there are variations of hand in some of the chapters. The book is entitled
""Les Proverbes de Solomon, escrites in diverses sortes des lettres, par Esther Anglois, Francoise:
A Lislebourge en Escosse, 1599,"" and is dedicated to the Earl of Essex. It is further ornamented
by an exquisitely neat representation of the arms of the unfortunate nobleman, with all their
quarterings, and by a pen-and-ink likeness of herself.

Several others of her works are carefully preserved in both England and Scotland; and some,
as late 1711, were in the possession of her own descendants.

At the age of forty, she married a Scottish gentleman, named Kello, or, as we would spell it
in these modern times, Kelly. The issue of this marriage was one son, named Samuel; and it
was her grandson, Samuel Kelly, who was in possession of various portions of her works in the
last century.

LADY PAKINGTON.

This celebrated lady, who flourished in the latter part of the seventeenth century, was the
daughter of Lord Coventry, Keeper of the Great Seal, and the wife of Sir John Pakington. She
was justly considered one of the celebrities of her day, and her society sought by the learned
divines with whom she was contemporary. She was the well-known author of several works of merit,
and the reputed author of others.

Ballard, who has given the world so many sketches of worthy and eminent women, with several
other writers of note, claims that it was she who wrote the treatise entitled ""The Whole Duty
of Man;"" and his reasoning is so much to the point, though quaint, that we simply append what
he says of her, with his apt quotations from her writings, as a sufficiently clear delineation
of the character and talents of this worthy woman. He writes:

""Yet hardly my pen will be thought capable of adding to the reputation her own has procured
to her, if it shall appear that she was the author of a work which is not more an honor to
the writer than a universal benefit to mankind. The work I mean is 'The Whole Duty of Man;'
her title to which has been so well ascertained, that the general concealment it has lain under
will only reflect a luster upon all her other excellencies by showing that she had no honor
in view but that of her Creator, which, I suppose, she might think best promoted by this concealment.
(The claims of other authors are not difficult to be disposed of.) If I were a Roman Catholic,
I would summon tradition as an evidence for me on this occasion, which has constantly attributed
this performance to a lady. And a late celebrated writer observes, that 'there are many probable
arguments in ""The Whole Duty of Man,"" to back a current report that it was written by a lady,'
And any one who reads 'The Lady's Calling,' may observe a great number of passages which clearly
indicate a female hand.

""That vulgar prejudice of the supposed incapacity of the female sex is what these memoirs in
general may possibly remove; and as I have had frequent occasion to take notice of it, I should
not now enter again upon that subject, had not this been made use of as an argument to invalidate
Lady Pakington's title to those performances. It may not be amiss, therefore, to transcribe
two or three passages from the treatise I have just now mentioned. 'But, waiving these reflections,
I shall fix only on the personal accomplishments of the sex, and peculiarly that which is the
most principal endowment of the rational nature--I mean the understanding--where it will be
a little hard to pronounce that they are naturally inferior to men, when it is considered how
much of intrinsic weight is put in the balance to turn it to the men's side. Men have their
parts cultivated and improved by education; refined and subtilized by learning and arts; are
like a piece of common which, by industry and husbandry, becomes a different thing from the
rest, though the natural turf owned no such inequality. We may, therefore, conclude that whatever
vicious impotence women are under, it is acquired, not natural; nor derived from any illiberality
of God's, but from the ill-managery of his bounty. Let them not charge God foolishly, or think
that by making them women, he necessitated them to be proud or wanton, vain or peevish; since
it is manifest he made them to better purpose; was not partial to the other sex; but that having,
as the prophet speaks, ""abundance of spirit,"" he equally dispensed it, and gave the feeblest
woman as large and capacious a soul as that of the greatest hero. Nay, give me leave to say
further, that as to an eternal well-being, he seems to have placed them in more advantageous
circumstances than he has done men. He has implanted in them some native propensions which
do much facilitate the operations of grace upon them,'

""And having made good this assertion, she interrogates thus: 'How many women do we read of
in the Gospel who, in all the duties of assiduous attendance on Christ, liberalities of love
and respect, nay, even in zeal and courage, surpassed even the apostles themselves? We find
his cross surrounded, his passion celebrated, by the avowed tears and lamentations of devout
women, when the most sanguine of his disciples had denied, yea, foresworn; and all had forsaken
him. Nay, even death itself could not extinguish their love. We find the devout Maries designing
a laborious, chargeable, and perhaps hazardous respect, to his corpse; and accordingly it is
a memorable attestation Christ gives to their piety by making them the first witnesses of his
resurrection, the prime evangelists to proclaim those glad tidings, and, as a learned man speaks,
apostles to the apostles.'

""There are many works of this lady besides 'The Whole Duty of Man,' enumerated in her biographies.""

MRS. MARY WASHINGTON.

The material at hand is too meagre to admit of giving such a sketch of this lady as would afford
any adequate idea of her character; and yet it is due to her memory, and to her nation, that
there should be some tribute to her worth.

The mother of General Washington is as much the mother of the Great Republic as was Mrs. Susannah
Wesley the mother of Methodism; for Washington owed the distinction to which he rose, and the
high niche he occupies in the history of the world's heroes, to the early and careful training
of his mother. Left a widow in a comparatively new and wild country, when her son George was
but ten years old, she fully realized the very great responsibility resting upon her as sole
remaining guardian of her children, and set herself to watch the bent of their inclinations,
and to direct their energies into a proper channel. Respecting the influence she exerted upon
them, her daughter-in-law, the wife of the President, many years afterward remarked: ""You speak
of the greatness of my husband. His dear mother ever looked well to the ways of her household.
She taught him to be industrious by her example.""

By her mild but firm management of her boy, she established a hold upon his affections, which
strengthened instead of decreasing with years; and when, in the later part of his life, honors
and distinctions were heaped upon him, he considered them rather as tributes to the worth of
his mother than to his own. As was natural to so adventurous a spirit, George early manifested
a predilection for the sea, and his elder brother encouraged him in thinking he might attain
distinction as a gallant mariner. A midshipman's berth was procured for him, at the age of
fifteen, on board of one of his majesty's ships, then off the coast of Virginia; and it seemed
as if the ardent desire of his boyhood was about to be realized. But when all was ready, his
mother gave expression to her disapproval of the expedition. Though sorely disappointed, he
at once acquiesced, and yielded to the representations made by her. Nor did she expect him
to give a ready acquiescence to her views without giving him valid reasons. She deemed him
quite too young to be removed from the salutary restraints of home, and from the influences
of its dearer ties. Years after, the colonists of Virginia and the North-west blessed the day
upon which Mrs. Washington refused her consent to her son's entering the navy, and thus kept
him to do them invaluable service in driving back from their territories the hostile Indians,
or more hostile French. Though a genuine F.F.V., she was never arrogant in her demeanor. In
her intercourse with those by whom she was surrounded, or with whom she came in contact, she
was simple and unaffected, the model of a true lady and a Christian.

Even in old age, she still watched carefully over the interests of her son. During the Winter
of 1777-1778, when the American soldiers were in such extremity at Valley Forge, she, as well
as the wife of Washington, spent her time in preparing comfortable clothing for them. Her spinning-wheel
and knitting-needles were rarely idle in those times of trial. A woman of proper discernment
and good judgment, it is scarcely necessary to say that she disapproved of extravagance of
every kind; and when the necessities of her country demanded the sacrifice of every thing not
an absolute necessity, she was found foremost in setting an example of plainness of dress.

Lafayette, with his aids-de-camp, paid her a visit of congratulation on the occasion of Washington's
successful passage of the Delaware, and found her dressed for their reception in a plain printed
gown, with her knitting--probably a stocking for some needy soldier--lying on a table near
her. Did the noble Frenchman and his companions deem their reception to have been less cordial
than they would have thought it had she arrayed herself in costly satin and lace, and received
them in idle state? Lafayette's own testimony of his appreciation of her remarkable worth answers
for itself.

At a good old age she died, and her country still reveres her memory.

MRS. WESLEY.

Taylor, the historian, gives Mrs. Wesley quite a prominent position in his account of the work
accomplished by her sons, and gives the following reason for doing so: ""The mother of the Wesleys
was the mother of Methodism."" One who was so intimately connected with the leaders of the Reformation
of the eighteenth century deserves a prominent position among the eminent women of modern history.

Mrs. Wesley was distinguished, from childhood, for rare mental ability; and, even at so early
an age as thirteen, had made theology a favorite study. Arrived at mature years, she made practical
use of the knowledge so carefully acquired in youth, and manifested unusual judgment and skill
in the early training and general management of her very large family. She did not confine
herself to the management of her domestic concerns alone, as many good mothers would have done,
though she carefully superintended them, but also overlooked the studies of her children; and
it was really her thorough training, and her subsequent counsels to John and Charles while
at Oxford, which produced in them the bent of mind that finally resulted in the great Methodist
movement.

Accustomed all her life to read with care the productions of the most eminent writers of her
own and preceding times, and to reflect upon what she read, she was able to arrive at correct
conclusions concerning questions of importance, whether they related to private matters or
to the public well-being. She had no more dread of Mrs. Grundy than her sons had. Once she
knew she was right, ""Society"" might either blame or praise, as it saw fit; she remained firm
in the carrying out of the measure--true to her principles.

When her sons, John and Charles, collected the common and poorer people about them, and began
preaching to them in the open fields, there was a fearful outcry. Old-time customs had been
innovated. Clergymen of the Church of England had departed from accustomed usage, and from
field or horseblock had proclaimed a full and free salvation through Christ to the very vilest
of the land, if they would but comply with the conditions laid down by him. The Profession
were aggrieved at such irregular proceedings. ""Society"" was scandalized that outcasts were
bidden to the same feast upon the same conditions with those reputed decent. Even Samuel Wesley
felt called upon to rebuke his brothers sharply for the reproach he considered they had brought
upon the Church by their ""intemperate zeal,"" But where was their mother meanwhile--she whose
counsels experience had proved it best to follow? Examining the Scriptures, and the history
of the primitive Church, to see wherein her sons had gone astray, that she might be in a position
to convince them of their error, if she found them to be in it. Careful study, however, convinced
her that they were only practicing the course followed by Christ and his apostles; and her
determination was taken. She would not only encourage them by her letters, but sustain them
and sanction their course by her presence. Accordingly, she went with her son John to Kensington
Common, and stood by him while he preached to a congregation of about ""twenty thousand people.""

It was Mrs. Wesley who counseled John to ponder well what he did before he forbade laymen to
address congregations; and her arguments on this point were so conclusive that they led him
to alter his mind and make use of them as an agency for good in the Church, though previously
he had considered such a proceeding a dangerous innovation.

During the life-time of her husband, it was her custom, in his absence, to allow those who
chose to come to assemble in a room of the old rectory at Epworth, on Sunday, and either read
them a sermon herself or have one of the elder children do it. Frequently, the office of reader
devolved upon her daughter Emily.

No matter into what department of her life you inquire, she is still found the same active,
energetic, and strong-minded woman. Nothing weak or puerile is found in her character. From
girlhood to maturity, from maturity to gray hairs, she pursues the same steady, uniform course.
Her life is consistent with the principles which she had laid down for her own self-government,
and which she believed were deduced from the Word of God.

At seventy-two years of age, she closed a long career of usefulness, dying, as the Christian
might be expected to die, in the triumphs of faith. Five of her daughters, and her son John,
were permitted to stand at her bedside and witness her peaceful end, and to comply with a request
made shortly before she died, that, as soon as the last struggle was ended, they should unite
in singing a psalm of praise for her release. 

She had always a bald way of telling herself the truth.

    Now she would face Dick in the same
    spirit. After all, she was his wife.
    He couldn't get away from that.
    

""Well,"" she said, ""I suppose you don't love me any more?""

Her voice was like her mother's, acid and selfish.

""Do you love me?"" asked Dick.

""No!"" said Lena. She saw him writhe and felt glad that she had the power to hurt him, but he
answered very gently.

""Then I still have the advantage of you, Lena. I love you, not in the old way I once dreamed
of loving--but still I love you. All this that I've said to-night was not spoken in the heat of anger.
I've known these facts for a long time, and you have never felt any change in my manner; but gradually
I have come to see that there could never be any genuine relations between us--you and me--so long as
you thought me just a silly dupe for you to get everything you could from, to be played on as you
pleased. We must begin again, a new way.

You don't love me, you say. I do love you, sweetheart, not for what I thought you were, but for
what you are, because you are my wife, because you need my tenderness and help. But I'm not going
to let you lead any longer. We can't even walk side by side as some husbands and wives do."" Dick
seemed to hear the voices of Ellery and Madeline by their own fireside, and he went on hurriedly.
""You needn't look at me that way, Lena, as if you were afraid of me. I shall want you to be comfortable
and happy. I shall try to give you the things you want--things--things--things! But I have some purposes
in life, and they, not you, are to be my master-spirits.""

Dick turned away and stared out of the winter window, stirred by his
own words into a strange new understanding of himself--a mere fatuous
self-believer, a man who trusted to fate not fight, to fortune not
to mastery, who had not made his standards, but let them make themselves.

And now it was come to this, that a half-hour in a room with a foolish girl was the turning-point
in his life.

He seemed strange to himself, as though he were examining a life from the outside rather than from
the inside, and fumbling at its real meaning.

He had done no wrong; but what does the march of events care whether the failure be intentional or
careless? Results follow just the same.

There flashed before his inward eye the face of his long-dead father, white and set with some
inward pain of which he did not speak.

Dick remembered that as a boy that had seemed to him a pitiful thing. Now he saw it somewhat
as the believers once saw the face of the martyr, the visible manifestation of triumph--the
success of being true to yourself in spite of all the world.

Dick drew a long breath and dropped his boyhood without even a regret. He knew he could accept
conditions and limitations and not kick against the pricks, but quietly, as one who is capable
of being superior to them. The bitterness, the depression of an hour, two hours, ago faded into
trifles, and the thing nearest to his consciousness was that dead father who had had his wound
and lived his life in spite of it; nearer, infinitely nearer, than the living wife whom a slight
noise brought to his remembrance. He had forgotten her. She belonged now to the elements outside
his dearest life.

He turned toward Lena, waiting, silent, uncomprehending,--poor little Lena, a woman who could
never be anything more. He felt a wave of strange new pity for her, unlike the pity he had once
experienced for her poverty of body, a sorrow, this, for what she was in herself, his wife--poor,
poor little child!

Lena sat still, picking at the bit of paper, but she looked up now, moved in spite of herself by
the exultant ring in Dick's voice, as he strode over to her and held out both his hands.

""And so we begin again--honestly, this time. Perhaps some day you'll
come to accept my standards inwardly as well as outwardly. Perhaps
you'll even come to love me, some day, little wife.""

Lena took his
hands submissively. Her small tyranny, her stock of little ambitions
had slipped from her and she shivered as though she was stripped and
cold; but behind there was a kind of delight in this new Dick, with
authoritative eyes into which she stared, wondering still, with trepidation,
what he was going to make of her life.

CHAPTER XXII

ANOTHER BEGINNING

Norris,
as he left Percival's house, had a glimpse of Lena coming down the
hall, wonderful in her shimmering evening gown, brave in jewels. She
dazzled him, though he despised his eyes for admiring her and told
himself that she was tinsel.

He bowed in response to her curt nod,
well aware that she thought him too unimportant to merit her courtesy,
while she resented her husband's inexplicable regard for him. He went
out into a cold winter drizzle and turned his face toward home and
Madeline, those new and thrilling possessions. For the moment, however,
there was no exhilaration in his heart, rather a depressed questioning
whether, after all, everything beautiful was a sham.

By what some would perhaps call a mere accidental circumstance, Miss Crosby found herself,
upon an occasion, in a position where she must speak to a congregation or send them home disappointed,
and be guilty of what she deemed an omission of a duty clearly pointed out to her by Providence.
She had given no intimation of any intention, on her part, of doing more than she usually did
at this place--simply leading her ordinary class--and had designed doing nothing more, when,
on her arrival there, she found nearly two hundred persons present anxious for instruction.
To lead the class in the customary manner was impossible. She, therefore, after conducting
the preliminary services, delivered a general address, dwelling particularly on the necessity
of repentance, and presenting Christ as a compassionate Redeemer. This extempore address was
attended with such beneficial results, that her friends insisted upon her exercising her very
evident talent in this direction, and, though averse to any thing like forwardness, she did
not feel that she was justified in refusing to comply with the wishes of those on whose judgment
she relied. Wherever she went, success attended her efforts, and she traveled extensively throughout
the kingdom, speaking sometimes to very large audiences.

Dr. Stevens, the celebrated American Methodist historian, thus sums up the work of a single
year. ""In that time,"" says he, ""she traveled nine hundred and sixty miles to hold two hundred
and twenty public meetings, and about six hundred select meetings, besides writing one hundred
and sixteen letters, many of them long ones, and holding many conversations in private with
individuals who wished to consult her on religious subjects."" In this latter department of
the Christian ministry she particularly excelled.

Like her friend, Mrs. Fletcher, she lived to a very old age; and at seventy-five, or nearly
that, calmly composed herself for death, by a vigorous effort of the will closing her own eyes
and mouth. Her demise occurred October 24, 1804.

ANN HASSELTINE.

The first wife of the Rev. Adoniram Judson was a brilliant exemplification of the truth of
the position we have advanced--namely, that a woman may be endowed with intellectual powers
of a high order; that she may assiduously cultivate those powers and employ them in advancing
objects that commend themselves to her judgment outside of her own family circle; that she
may become an active and efficient participator in affairs of a public nature, requiring of
her wisdom, eloquence, and courage; and all this without her deteriorating in the slightest
degree in any of the valuable qualities or attractive graces that characterize a truly womanly
woman.

Mrs. Judson's history, as connected with the Burmese Mission, which her husband and herself
were instruments in the hand of God in establishing, is too well known to require extended
notice here. A few points, however, may be glanced at. Throughout the difficulties which beset
them during the first year after their arrival at Calcutta, when there seemed to be no open
door through which they might enter upon their destined work, and all their hopes of usefulness
seemed doomed to disappointment, Mrs. Judson was as little disposed to succumb to these adverse
circumstances as her husband.

The British East India Company did not favor Christian missions, and were at that time (1812)
particularly unfriendly to American missionaries. They had spent but a few days in the congenial
society of the venerable Dr. Carey's hospitable home, when they were ordered, by the Government,
to leave the country and return to America. Hoping to be allowed to prosecute their work in
some country not under the Company's jurisdiction, they solicited and obtained permission to
go to the Isle of France. But before Mr. and Mrs. Judson were able to secure a passage there,
they received a new order from the Government commanding them to embark on a vessel bound for
England.

Just then they heard of a vessel about to sail for the Isle of France, and applied for a passport
to go on her, but were refused. The captain, however, though knowing of the refusal, allowed
them to embark. The vessel was overtaken by a Government dispatch, forbidding the pilot to
conduct it further seaward, because there were persons on board who had been ordered to England.
They were obliged to land; but finally the captain was induced to disregard orders so far as
to allow Mrs. Judson to return to the vessel, and to convey her and their baggage to a point
opposite a tavern, a number of miles down the river, Mr. Judson being left to make his way
as best he could.

Let us imagine that refined and tenderly reared lady, landing from the pilot's boat, which
he had kindly sent to take her ashore, alone, a stranger in a foreign land, uncertain of the
character of the place in which she was obliged to seek shelter, and not knowing what might
occur to prevent her husband rejoining her. Instead of weakly yielding to despondency, she
promptly engaged a boat to go out after the vessel, to bring their effects ashore. Then, though
impenetrable darkness so shrouded their future that she could not see how the next step was
to be taken, she looked for light upon their pathway, and deliverance from their perplexities,
to Him whom they served, and calmly trusted the issue to Him. Before night, Mr. Judson arrived
at the place where his wife waited, in safety, as did also their baggage.

For three days they could see no way out of their difficulty. Then they received, from an unknown
friend, the necessary pass. Hastening down the river at a point seventy miles distant, they
found the vessel they had left, were received on board, and allowed to continue their voyage.

When they dropped anchor at the Isle of France, the dangers of the voyage, and the trials that
had preceded it over, they were looking forward to a season of enjoyment in the society of
their associate missionaries, Mr. and Mrs. Newell, who had accompanied them on the voyage from
America, and had preceded them from Calcutta to the Isle of France. But disappointment deeper,
sadder than any that had gone before, awaited them. Mrs. Judson says: ""Have at last arrived
in port; but O, what news--what distressing news!

To her sorrow for her friend and her anxiety at the uncertainties of their situation, was added,
while on the island, a severe attack of illness. But when a field supposed to be accessible
to missionaries was determined upon, though only partially recovered, she cheerfully prepared
to brave new dangers and the repetition of former trials. They sailed for Madras; and, on their
arrival there, found but one ship in the harbor ready for sea, and that not bound for their
desired port, but for Burma. They had intended going to Burma when they first arrived in India,
but had been dissuaded from so doing by the representations of their friends that the country
was altogether inaccessible to missionaries. They dared not remain long in Madras, lest the
officials of the East India Company should send them back to America. Thus, every other way
being closed up against them, they were obliged to turn their faces toward that country in
which they became so eminently useful.

The voyage was one of discomfort and peril. When they arrived at Rangoon, then the capital
of Burma, Mrs. Judson was so weak that she had to be carried in an arm-chair from the landing.
Thankful to have at last found a resting-place, they as quickly as possible established themselves
in the house they were to occupy.

As soon as Mrs. Judson's health was sufficiently restored, they gave their attention to the
study of the Burmese language. It is worthy of remark, that although Mrs. Judson charged herself
with the entire management of family affairs, in order that Mr. Judson might not be interrupted
in prosecuting the study of the language, yet she made more rapid progress in acquiring it
than he did. Subsequently, she studied the Siamese language also, and translated a Catechism
and one of the Gospels into that tongue. As soon as she was able to make herself understood,
she diligently endeavored to impart the knowledge of the truth, as it is in Jesus, to those
who would listen to her instructions. Though they were attentive and inquisitive, it was long
before fruit appeared; but undiscouraged, she, with prayer and faith, continued to sow beside
all waters.

Mrs. Judson was surprised at the native intelligence and reflecting minds possessed by some
of the Burmese women.

Mrs. Judson's politic mind seeing the probable importance to the mission of making friends
in high places, she procured an introduction to the wife of the viceroy, and, while visiting
her, met the viceroy also.

Thus studying, teaching, and planning; laboring with her hands, and enduring pain, sickness,
and sorrow; unsolaced by Christian society, except her husband's,--three anxious years passed.

In their course, her first-born had come to warm her heart with a new love, and, for a few
brief months, to delight them with the unfolding of his baby graces. Then death entered, and
bore away their darling, and left hearts and home more lonely than before.

The arrival of additional missionaries from America--Mr. and Mrs. Hough--in the Autumn of 1816,
for a time greatly cheered and encouraged them. But fresh trials were in store for them. Mr.
Judson had embarked for the province of Arracan; and when they were daily looking for his return,
a vessel arrived from the port to which he had sailed, bringing the disheartening tidings that
neither he nor the vessel in which he had sailed had been heard of there. While, tortured by
suspense on Mr. Judson's account, new terrors alarmed the mission family. Mr. Hough was ordered
to the court-house, and detained there for days under a threat that ""if he did not tell all
the truth in relation to the foreigners, they would write with his heart's blood."" Not understanding
the language of his accusers, he was unable to plead his own cause, and he had no male friend
to do it for him. Had Mrs. Judson, in this extremity, allowed herself to be absorbed in her
own sorrow, or yielded to timidity, Mr. Hough would probably have suffered a long and rigorous
confinement, if indeed he had escaped with his life. But undaunted by the odium, or even danger,
that might accrue to herself, she, in violation of court etiquette, presented herself at the
palace with a petition in Mr. Hough's behalf. The viceroy, without manifesting any displeasure
at the breach of etiquette, ordered Mr. Hough to be set at liberty.

Six months of painful suspense passed, and yet no tidings of Mr. Judson. That dreadful scourge,
the cholera, was raging, and they were alarmed by rumors of war. Mr. Hough resolved to remove
his family to Bengal, and urged Mrs. Judson to accompany them. Therefore she yielded to the
solicitations of Mr. and Mrs. Hough, and embarked with them. But, reviewing all the conditions
of the case as the vessel slowly made its way down the river, it became clear to her mind that
whatever were the dangers of her position at Rangoon, yet there was her post of duty. Once
convinced of what was duty, this heroic woman was not to be deterred from it by dangers, however
formidable. Her resolution was taken; and, having prevailed upon the captain to send a boat
up the river with her, she returned alone to the mission-house. The wisdom of her decision
was proved in a short time by the safe return of Mr. Judson. Later, when failing health necessitated
a change of climate, Mrs. Judson showed herself as well adapted to moving gracefully in cultivated
and refined society as she was to contending with adversity and danger in a heathen land.

Her eloquent appeals, both in England and America, in behalf of the perishing millions of the
East, and her history of the Burmese Mission, prepared during her visit to the United States,
stirred up missionary zeal in the heart of Protestant Christendom, and gave an impetus to the
cause of missions that has gone on accelerating to the present time.

In the mean time, other missionaries had arrived in Burma, among whom was Dr. Price, the fame
of whose skill in medicine reached the ears of the king; and Dr. Price was ordered to Ava,
then the capital. Dr. Price obeyed the summons; and Mr. Judson, anxious to make another effort
to procure toleration for the Christians, accompanied him. The king received them kindly, determined
to retain Dr. Price at Ava, and urgently insisted upon Mr. Judson's remaining also. Rejoiced
to find the king so favorably disposed toward the Christians, Mr. Judson resolved to accept
the invitation, but represented that he must return to Rangoon for his wife.

A few days after Mrs. Judson arrived from America, they therefore left Rangoon, and commenced
a mission at Ava; which soon became to them the theater of such martyr-like sufferings and
exalted heroism as to do justice to which would require a volume. Erelong, the war so long
feared between the British and the Burmese actually broke out. The Englishmen at Ava were all
seized and imprisoned, and with them Mr. Judson and Dr. Price. In vain the missionaries protested
that they were not Englishmen. Identical with the latter in language, religion, manners, dress,
etc., and receiving their funds through an English house, the Burmese could not, or would not,
understand that they belonged to another nation.

Mrs. Judson was not allowed to leave her own house till the third day; a guard having been
placed around it, and no one allowed to enter or leave it but at the penalty of life. She obtained
egress at last, by causing the governor to be informed that she wished to visit him with a
present. The guard were then ordered to allow her to pass. Her plea for their release was without
effect; but she was directed to an officer with whom she might arrange with regard to making
them more comfortable. By paying a considerable sum of money to this man, she obtained a promise
that their sufferings should be mitigated.

The Governor gave her an order for her admittance to the prison, but she was not allowed to
enter. She saw Mr. Judson at the door, whither he crawled to speak with her. But even this
sad communing was cut short by a rude order to Mrs. Judson to ""depart, or they would pull her
out."" She was, however, allowed to supply the prisoners with food, and mats to lie upon.

This was the beginning of a long series of such visits to the prison--of efforts for the comfort
of the prisoners, and appeals in their behalf to jailers, petty officers, magistrates, governors,
or members of the royal family.

She was subjected to all manner of extortion and annoyance, being repeatedly brought before
the authorities on the most absurd charges. The fear that her husband would be put to death
so haunted her, that she was willing to meet the most exorbitant demands, hoping thereby to
conciliate his persecutors.

After she had succeeded in effecting some slight improvement in their condition, all was reversed
by a disastrous battle; the success of the British being visited upon the prisoners, by the
withdrawal of all the little comforts Mrs. Judson had at so much cost and trouble obtained
for them. When they were dragged from one city to another, she followed, renewing the same
wearing round of toiling, pleading, paying, to procure some alleviation of their misery.

The war being over, Mr. Judson determined to remove into one of the provinces ceded to the
British; and the new town of Amherst was selected as their place of residence.

The natives converted to Christianity through the instrumentality of the missionaries, had
been dispersed during the war; and many of them now gathered to Amherst, to enjoy again the
instructions of their beloved teachers. Their prospects now seemed highly encouraging; and
Mr. Judson departed on a journey by which he hoped to advance the interests of the mission,
leaving Mrs. Judson engaged with her characteristic energy in carrying forward arrangements
to facilitate their work.

But never more were that clear head, ready hand, and sympathetic heart to aid or encourage
him in his labors, or succor him in the hour of calamity. Her work was done.

A fever seized her, and her constitution, undermined by the exhausting sufferings, mental and
physical, through which she had passed during the war, was not able to withstand the violence
of the disease. There, without husband or kindred to receive her frail infant from her paralyzing
arms, or to speak words of love or comfort in her dying ears, she battled with the last enemy,
and terminated her singularly eventful and useful life. The annals in the East present us with
no parallel.""

SARAH HALL BOARDMAN JUDSON.

Who so worthily followed in the footsteps of the first Mrs. Judson, arrived in India with her
first husband, the Rev. George D. Boardman, while Mr. Judson and his fellow-sufferers were
still prisoners in Ava. They remained in Calcutta till the close of the war, and some time
after, preparing themselves by the study of the Burmese language, etc., for their subsequent
career of usefulness in Burma.

After they had joined the other missionaries at Amherst, Maulmain was determined upon as the
scene of their future labors, and thither they repaired. The dangers that encompassed their
new residence were such as in the presence of which even stout hearts might have been excused
for quailing. The mission-house was a slight structure of bamboos, constituting scarcely any
obstruction to assailants disposed to effect an entrance, and in such close proximity to the
jungle that the slumbers of the missionaries were frequently disturbed by the howling of the
wild beasts, whose lairs had so recently given place to human habitations. Maulmain was then
a new city that had suddenly sprung into existence within the territory ceded to the British.

They had been settled in their new abode but a few weeks, when it was entered in the night
by robbers, who overhauled all their effects, and carried away most of their valuables while
they slept.

After the robbery, a guard was sent from the English barracks to protect the missionaries in
case of another visit from the marauders. One of the guard narrowly escaped death from a wild
beast, which, rushing out of the jungle, leaped upon him while he was seated upon the veranda
of the mission-house. Happily there was help at hand, and the animal was frightened away before
the man had sustained serious injury.

Do we find Mrs. Boardman, while thus continually exposed to attacks of ravenous beasts and
fierce banditti, deploring her situation, or expressing a desire to relinquish their work and
return to the security and comfort of civilized life? On the contrary, she characterizes the
months in which these events were transpiring as among the happiest of her life, because she
felt that they were in the path of duty.

Afterward, in order to the further extension of missionary operations in the country, it was
judged advisable for Mr. and Mrs. Boardman to leave the infant Church and the schools they
had so successfully established at Maulmain, to the care of the other missionaries, and to
proceed themselves to Tavoy. Accordingly, they sundered the ties that bound them to their first
Indian home, and to the natives in whose conversion they had been instrumental, and again devoted
their energies to breaking up new ground.

At Tavoy, after overcoming various obstacles and discouragements, they succeeded in establishing
schools, and were cheered by indications of prosperity and some conversions among the natives.

The conversion of a Karen having attracted Mr. Boardman's attention to that interesting tribe,
he, though scarcely recovered from a dangerous illness, made a tour among them with very gratifying
results. It required no small amount of courage and of exalted devotion to the cause in which
they were engaged to make Mrs. Boardman willing to be left, with her two little ones, among
the natives in such a place, and with no better protection from outside dangers than a bamboo
hut, her mind, at the same time, distressed by sad forebodings as to the probable consequence
to her husband's feeble health of the exposures, toils, and dangers inseparable from his journey.
But she was equal to this and to sorer trials which yet awaited them at Tavoy. Some of these
were consequences of the rebellion of the Tavoyans against the British.

It was fortunate for Mr. and Mrs. Boardman that they, at that time, resided in a place occupied
by a British force; small though the force was, yet to its presence they were probably indebted
for their exemption from aggravated sufferings, if not from death itself.

From a letter of Mr. Boardman's we take some extracts.

On the kind invitation of Mrs. Burney, the wife of the English resident, who happened to be
absent, they sought shelter from the storm of bullets in the Government-house. But, through
the kind care of our Heavenly Father, we were preserved alive, and nothing of importance occurred
until the morning of Thursday, a little before daybreak, when a party of five hundred advanced
upon us from the town, and set fire to several houses and vessels near the warf. Yes: her mind
was stayed by a 'courage not her own;' ... its calmness was that of a child who, in its utter
helplessness, clings to its father's arm.""

Her distress was aggravated by the alarming illness of her little boy, caused by the foul air
of the warf-house and the absence of accustomed comforts; but, by the blessing of God upon
her watchful care, it was spared to her.

The rebellion being suppressed, Mr. Boardman set about repairing the mischief it had wrought.
Their house had been cut to pieces, and their books, clothing, furniture, etc., carried off,
mutilated, or destroyed. He gathered up such fragments as remained, and made the best arrangements
in his power for future comfort and usefulness. Illness and other causes detained Mrs. Boardman
for some time at Maulmain; but, before Winter, she had returned, and they were again engaged
in their ""loved employ,"" and were greatly strengthened and encouraged by seeing the good seed
they had so faithfully sown amid opposition and discouragement, bringing forth fruit in the
conversion of the heathen. But, even while rejoicing in these triumphs of the truth, Mrs. Boardman
could not conceal from herself the conviction that a greater sorrow than any she had yet known
was coming upon her. She had already twice experienced the agony that wrings the hearts of
bereaved parents. Of their three children, two had been taken from them by death,--their first-born,
a lovely and promising little girl of two years and eight months; and, afterward, their second
son, a beautiful babe of eight months. But all the suffering and sorrow that she had yet endured
seemed as nothing in comparison with that which now threatened to overwhelm her. Her beloved
husband, who had been her comfort and solace under previous bereavements, was now himself too
evidently passing away.

Ardently affectionate in her nature, she suffered intense anguish of spirit; but instead of
giving way to rebellious repinings, the poor bruised heart carried its sorrows to the Great
Healer, and in his strength she girded herself with fresh courage to do all that might yet be done.

When her dying husband could not be dissuaded from employing the last remnant of his ebbing
life in another visit to his beloved Karens, we find her taking her place beside his portable
couch, that his sufferings might receive every possible alleviation; that he might lack no
tender attention that the most devoted love could give.

They arrived at their destination on the third day, and found awaiting them nearly a hundred
natives, more than half of whom were applicants for baptism. The place prepared for the accommodation
of Mr. and Mrs. Boardman and their little boy, was a room five feet wide and ten feet long,
so low that Mrs. Boardman could not stand upright in it, and so insufficiently inclosed as
not to shelter the sufferer from the cold and damp of the night air, or the scorching rays
of the sun by day. Those who have known what it is to watch beside dying loved ones, witnessing
suffering that they were powerless to relieve, can imagine the anguish that Mrs. Boardman endured
in seeing her husband so near his end in that miserable place, destitute of the little comforts
so needful in sickness. But with heroic determination she repressed her own sorrow, lest it
might incapacitate her for assisting him while rallying his expiring energies for one more
effort in his Master's cause. The poor worn body, though, was found unequal to the task assigned
it by the zealous spirit, and he was forced to admit that his work was done.

Thus they passed the last night of his life; and, before another night, it was but a lifeless
corpse that the attendants were bearing back to her now desolate home.

In her grief and loneliness, her heart doubtless yearned for the soothing sympathy of her kindred
and friends in her native land. Who would have censured her, if in view of what had been achieved
among the natives since their coming to Tavoy, and of all the trials and toils and dangers
of her Indian life, it had seemed to her that her work was accomplished; and that it would
then be no desertion of duty for her, with her little boy to educate, to return to America?
If, during the first sad days of her bereavement, such thoughts flitted through her mind, they
did not long find lodgment there. Soon the native converts began to come to her, as of old,
with their difficulties and perplexities, and inquiries for instruction. The duty of responding
to these appeals forbade the indulgence of engrossing sorrow, and caused her to realize that,
when work for the Master was pressing on every hand, and one of the laborers had fallen in
the field, his fellow-laborers, instead of relaxing their efforts, should feel it imperative
on them, if possible, to redouble their diligence.

Thenceforward her labors became more onerous than they had been during Mr. Boardman's life;
and they continued so, even after the arrival of the new missionaries, Mr. Mason and his wife,
who of necessity were chiefly occupied with the study of the language.

Later, she writes: ""The superintendence of the food and clothing of both the boarding-schools,
together with the care of five day-schools under native teachers, devolves wholly on me.""

She also made difficult journeys through the wild jungles to the Karen villages, to strengthen,
encourage, and instruct the poor natives; thus performing efficiently, though informally, the
work of an evangelist.

After her marriage with Dr. Judson, and her consequent return to Maulmain, she was still busily
engaged in conducting schools, Bible-class, etc., besides attending to her family. She also
learned the Peguan language, into which she translated the New Testament, a Life of Christ,
and several tracts. In Burmese she had previously become proficient, and she translated ""Bunyan's
Pilgrim's Progress"" into that language. A number of the hymns prepared for the use of the mission
were also from her pen.

At Maulmain she was exposed to fewer vicissitudes and dangers than at Tavoy, so that the intrepid
aspect of her character became less conspicuous; but her life was filled up with increased
maternal responsibilities and domestic cares, added to other arduous labors of the same class
with those which she had previously discharged with so much sound judgment, and in which she
exhibited so happily the ability to influence and govern those under her control, and at the
same time to win their love and reverence for herself.

In early life she wooed the Muses with respectable success; and though the stern labors of
mature years left her little leisure for the indulgence of poetic fancies, yet the last expression
of her love committed to writing flowed from her pen in numbers of touching grace and tenderness.

Her constitution having been broken down by her incessant toils, a voyage to America was recommended
in order to recuperate it. On the voyage thither, when between the Isle of France and St. Helena,
she died, and was buried on the latter island.

We have selected these two gifted Christian women as representative missionary women, who,
though brilliant examples, did not excel many others in the host of devoted women who have
gone out from Great Britain and America into the dark places of the earth, on the same godlike
errand.

We have already mentioned the honored names of several philanthropic ladies, whose works praise
them throughout Europe and America. The list might be extended indefinitely, but we have space
for but a few.

THE MISSES CHANDLER.

The National Hospital erected for the Paralyzed and Epileptic (England) owes its origin to
the humane efforts of two sisters, Joanna and Louisa Chandler. These ladies, finding that among
all the charitable institutions existing in London there was not one into which a poor paralyzed
man would be admitted, conceived the idea of establishing a hospital for that particular class
of sufferers. Though only in moderate circumstances, they devoted two hundred pounds of their
own means to the object. For five years, they received no assistance; but their continued appeals
at length attracted public attention. Various philanthropic gentlemen and ladies became interested
in the enterprise. The necessary funds were collected mainly by the exertions of Miss J. Chandler
and the ladies who had associated themselves with her, and the hospital became an accomplished
fact.

The same persevering energy, directed by sound judgment and practical business talent, was
conspicuously displayed by Miss Adaline Cooper, in her efforts for the improvement of the condition
and morals of the costermongers of Tothill Fields, Westminster. Among the degraded, they as
a class were regarded as the most degraded. But, strong in her faith in the power of kindness,
she went in among them, and commenced day and night schools, a Sunday-school, a mothers' meeting,
and a temperance society. Through these appliances she influenced the women and children, but
the men stood aloof. The more desperate even threatened to drive her and her assistants away;
but she was not to be intimidated. She erected a handsome building for a Costermongers' Club;
and constructed a dwelling-house large enough to accommodate fifty or sixty families. The entire
expenditure for these purposes amounted to nearly nine thousand pounds.

Soon after the Club was formed, a large number of the members, perceiving the benefit of abstinence,
signed the pledge. She formed a Bible-class for their improvement, and established a penny-bank
for the Band of Hope.

In reward of her labors, she had the satisfaction of seeing a marked reformation in both their
morals and circumstances. Very many of these poor people, the very name of whose calling had
been a synonym for dishonesty and kindred vices, became sober, industrious, and honest men
and women.

Sketches innumerable of other women of very great merit, particularly of those who have enriched
our literature during the present century, might be added, did the limits of so small a volume
permit; which it does not. It must suffice, therefore, to mention the names of a few of these,
while the names of many others equally meritorious must necessarily be omitted.

First, we write Mrs. Browning, a name surrounded by a halo of glory from the scintillations
of her own genius.

Charlotte Bronté, Miss Mulock, Mrs. Wood, and Mrs. Oliphant form a brilliant galaxy, but scarcely
outshine others in the same department.

Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe has made her mark upon her age, and is not likely to be forgotten
while the War of Secession is remembered.

The sweet strains of the sisters Cary will linger long in the ears and hearts of the lovers
of song.

The name of the gentle Swede, Fredrika Bremer, will live as long as the language in which she
writes shall be spoken or read; while Mary Howitt, her translator, is, through these beautiful
translations, and her own inimitably chaste and home-like stones, endeared to both English
and American hearts.

Mrs. Willard will bear a favorable comparison with any other American historian, let him be
ever so famous.

Mrs. Moodie and her gifted sisters, Mrs. Trail and Miss Strickland, have acquired a world-wide
reputation by their pens.

Which of our living authors possesses a more terse or vigorous style than Gail Hamilton? And
where are more self-sacrificing spirits to be found than in those bands of lady missionaries,
worthy successors of Harriet Newell and Ann Hasseltine Judson, who every year leave our coasts
to carry the Gospel to heathen lands?

Large numbers of clever women are attracting the attention of the thinking people of both England
and America, not only as public speakers and leaders of much-needed reforms, but for the honorable
position to which they have attained in literary and scientific circles and in the arts. The
scenes, however, in which they are the active participants are still transpiring; and therefore
these women, some of them both honorable and great, in the best and highest acceptation of
the terms, can not just at the present be classed among the women of history. But though they
are not far enough back in the past to be placed in this category, they are furnishing the
materials for both an instructive and an interesting one in the future; and that future, too,
not very far distant. All honor to the brave, the good, and true among them.

THE END

"
2,suspicious-document00003.txt,"I do not remember that I was ""very angry"" about Hooker's despatch, as General Sherman says
(Vol. II, page 59), though I think Sherman was.  Indeed, he had more reason to be angry than
I; for the fact, and evidence of it, were so plain that the Twenty-third Corps had done its
duty as ordered, that if Hooker's despatch was meant to imply the contrary, which I doubt,
that was a cause of anger to the general-in-chief, whom he had unnecessarily alarmed, rather
than to me, who had no apprehension of being suspected by the general-in-chief of having failed
in my duty.

In fact, I do not recollect having seen Hooker's despatch at all until I saw it quoted in Sherman's
""Memoirs.""  My recollection is that Sherman told me, on his visiting us the next day, that
he had received during the battle a despatch from Hooker to the effect that his flank was unprotected.
In reply to this I explained to General Sherman where my troops had been during the engagement,
and showed him the dead of the 14th Kentucky lying on the advanced ground they had held while
Hascall's division was forming.  I believe that if I had seen Hooker's despatch at the time,
I should have interpreted it then, as I do now, as referring, not to his immediate right, but
to the extreme right of the line.  I do not recollect any words, ""pretty sharp"" or otherwise,
between General Hooker and myself on that subject, and do not believe it was ever mentioned
between us.  In short, I do not think I was present at the interview in the ""little church""
described by General Sherman (Sherman's ""Memoirs,"" Vol. II, page 59).  I have an impression
that General Hascall was there, and that it is to him General Sherman refers.  I believe the
Kolb House difficulty was almost entirely a misapprehension between General Sherman and General
Hooker.  Why this mistake was not explained at the time or afterward I do not know, unless
it was that the feelings of those two gentlemen toward each other were unfavorable to any such
explanation.

I will add that General Hooker and I were together both before and after the opening of the
Kolb House engagement.  He knew perfectly well where my troops were, and what they were doing,
and it seems to me utterly impossible that he can have meant by his despatch what General Sherman
understood it to mean.

My despatches of that date to Sherman show that I had no special apprehension even in respect
to our extreme right flank, and that I doubted the report that one whole corps was in our front.

My orders on that day,( 2) show that Hascall was up with Hooker at the intersection of the
Marietta and Powder Spring roads, near the Kolb House, as early as 3 P. M., and that Cox was
ordered up with three brigades at 4:15 P. M., before the assault began.  Cox arrived with the
head of his column during the enemy's attack, and was directed by me in person where and how
to put his troops in position.  Hence I think I must be right in the inference that in Hooker's
despatch to Sherman of 5:30 P. M., the words ""our extreme right flank"" must have been intended
to refer to my extreme right, and not his.  He was simply unduly apprehensive for the safety
of the extreme right flank of the army, not of his own corps in particular.  My report to General
Sherman at 9 P. M. simply shows that I did not share that apprehension; that, instead of believing
there were ""three entire corps in front of us,"" I doubted whether there was even all of Hood's
corps.

General Hooker's habit of swinging off from the rest of General Thomas's army, and getting
possession of roads designated for McPherson or for me, was a common subject of remark between
Sherman, Thomas, McPherson, and myself; and his motive was understood to be, as General Sherman
states, to get command of one of the armies, in the event of battle, by virtue of his senior
commission.  But the subject was never mentioned between General Hooker and me, and he never
even approximated to giving me an order.  No doubt he entertained the opinion that he would
have a right to give orders to either General McPherson or myself under certain circumstances
likely to arise, for General Sherman entertained the same opinion. What General Thomas thought
on the question I never knew.  My own opinion and McPherson's were decidedly the contrary.

                            CONVERSATION OVER THE QUESTION OF RELATIVE RANK

In the final movement which resulted in the withdrawal of Johnston's army from Kenesaw, the
Army of the Tennessee passed by the right flank of my infantry line along the famous Sandtown
Road.  While this was going on, McPherson and I sat on our horses together a long time, observing
the movement and renewing the familiar intercourse of our youth.  We had a long and free conversation
on a great variety of subjects--a rare opportunity for commanders, even in the same army, where
their troops were generally from ten to twenty miles apart in line of battle.  One of the first
subjects that came up was that question of relative rank; for our troops had ""met"" and were
then ""doing duty together,"" in the language of the old article of war.  But the subject was
quickly dismissed with the remark, made almost simultaneously by both, that such a question
could not possible cause any difficulty between us.  McPherson had the senior commission of
major-general, and I the senior assignment as army commander.  Perhaps it would have puzzled
even Halleck to frame a satisfactory decision in that peculiar case.  I had long before determined
what my decision would be if that question ever became a practical one between McPherson and
myself on the field of battle.  I would have said, in substance at least:  ""Mac, just tell
me what you want me to do.""

As we sat together that day, McPherson confided to me the secret of his marriage engagement,
for the purpose, as he stated, of inquiring whether, in my opinion, he could before long find
a chance to go home and get married.  I told him I thought that after the capture of Atlanta
operations would be suspended long enough for that.  But my dear and noble friend was killed
in the next great battle.  After Atlanta had fallen I went home, as McPherson would doubtless
have done if he had lived; but our common friend and classmate Hood cut the visit so short
that there would have been little time for marriage festivities.

McPherson, among other high qualities, was one of the most generous men I ever knew.  He was
remarkably skilful in topographical drawing, etching, lettering, and all other uses of the
pen.  Although at the head of the class and a most conscientious student whose time was very
valuable to himself, he would spend a very large part of that precious time in ""lettering""
problems for classmates who needed such help.  For this reason and others he was, by common
consent of all the classes, the most popular man in the corps.  I could not compete with ""Mac""
at all in the lettering business, but I tried to follow his good example, in my own way, by
helping the boys over knotty points in ""math"" and ""phil.""  I had taught district school one
winter before going to West Point, and hence had acquired the knack of explaining things.

Hood was not well up in mathematics.  The first part of the course especially he found very
hard--so much so that he became discouraged. After the unauthorized festivities of Christmas,
particularly, he seemed much depressed.  On the 26th he asked me which I would prefer to be,
""an officer of the army or a farmer in Kentucky?""  I replied in a way which aroused his ambition
to accomplish what he had set out to do in coming to West Point, without regard to preference
between farming and soldiering.  He went to work in good earnest, and passed the January examinations,
though by a very narrow margin. From that time on he did not seem to have so much difficulty.
When we were fighting each other so desperately fifteen years later, I wondered whether Hood
remembered the encouragement I had given him to become a soldier, and came very near thinking
once or twice that perhaps I had made a mistake.  But I do not believe that public enmity ever
diminished my personal regard for my old friend and classmate.

                                   VISIT TO THE CAMP OF FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.

In thinking of McPherson, I recall an interesting incident connected with Frank P. Blair, Jr.'s
arrival with his corps about June 9, referred to by General Sherman (Vol. II, page 24).  For
some reason we had an afternoon's rest the day after Blair arrived; so I rode over to his camp--seven
or eight miles, perhaps--to greet my old friend.  McPherson, to whose army Blair's corps belonged,
and other officers were there.  To our immense surprise, Blair had brought along great hogsheads
of ice and numerous baskets of champagne, as if to increase the warmth of our welcome.  Of
course we did not disdain such an unusual treat in the enemy's country.  About sunset McPherson
invited me to visit his camp, and we started off at a full gallop, which we kept up all the
way, yet it was some time after dark when we reached the headquarters of the Army of the Tennessee.
A good camp supper was awaiting us, with jolly young officers to make it merry.  It was not
until supper was ended that I began to realize the necessity of a night's march to get back
to my own camp.  As our infantry line was twenty miles long, and the cavalry stretched it out
on either flank as many more, my single orderly was quite sufficient protection from any attack
by the enemy; but the Georgia bushes, brambles, and mud, combined with the absence of any known
road, constituted an enemy hard to overcome. However, by the aid of the compass which I have
always carried in my head since I used to hunt in the wilds of the West, I got back to camp,
and went to bed, taking care not to observe the time of night by my watch.

As I have said, I was often much annoyed by General Hooker's corps getting possession of roads
which had been designated for mine to advance upon, thus greatly delaying my movements.  But
it is but just to say that this is susceptible of an explanation much more creditable to General
Hooker than that given by General Sherman. General Thomas's army was so large that he could
never get his three corps into position as soon as expected by the use of the roads designated
for him.  Hence, when Hooker was not in advance he would ""switch off"" and hunt for another
road to the right or left, and thus sometimes strike in ahead of McPherson or me, and leave
us no road at all to move on.  In fact, the army was so large and the roads were so few that
our movements were often painfully slow and tedious, and General Hooker's motive may have been
only to get ahead and bring his corps into action or to the position assigned to it in whatever
way he could.

                                  ANECDOTE OF SHERMAN AND HOOKER UNDER FIRE

The first time I ever saw General Sherman and General Hooker together, or got even a suspicion
that their personal relations were other than the most satisfactory, was at Resaca.  Cox's
division had gained possession of some portions of the enemy's outer works, so that from a
bald hill just in rear of our line some parts of the main line of defense could be distinctly
seen.  Upon my informing General Sherman of this, he soon appeared on the ground, accompanied
or closely followed by a large number of general and staff officers. Besides Sherman, Thomas,
Hooker, and Newton, a score of others were there, all eager to see what they could of the now
famous stronghold which McPherson had refrained from assaulting.  I led them to the hill, on
which a few dead trees were still standing, and from which the much-desired view could be obtained.
Of course all were on foot, yet they were too numerous not to attract the attention of the
enemy.  Very soon the sound of musketry in front, then not very heavy, was varied by the sharp
explosion of a shell overhead, and fragments of branches of dead trees came falling all around.
A general ""scatteration"" occurred in all directions save one.  Newton and I, who were conversing
at the time, quietly stepped aside a few paces out of the line of fire, where we were much
safer than we would have been in full retreat, and then turned round to see what had become
of our companions.  All save two had disappeared, even Thomas having abandoned the field, probably
for the first and only time in his life.  But still there, on the bald hill, in full view of
the hostile artillery, were the two already highly distinguished generals, Sherman and Hooker,
both alike famous for supreme courage, striding round the ground, appearing to look at nothing
in particular and not conversing with each other, but seeming at least a foot taller than usual,
each waiting for the other to lead off in retreat.  After quite a long continuance of this
little drama, which greatly entertained Newton and me, the two great soldiers, as if by some
mysterious impulse,--for they did not speak a word,--simultaneously and slowly strode to the
rear, where their horses were held.  I cheerfully gave the ""Johnny Rebs"" credit for the courtesy
of not firing another shot after they saw the effect of the first, which I doubt not was intended
only as a gentle hint that such impudence in Yankees was not to be tolerated.  Yet a single
shell from the same direction,--probably from the same battery,--when we were moving into action
that morning, exploded near my head, and killed the aide who was riding behind me.( 3)  My
too numerous staff and escort had attracted attention. I had at Dalton a few days before forbade
the staff and escort to follow me into action, unless specially ordered to do so; but they
had not so soon learned the lesson which the sad casualty at Resaca taught them.  It was then
early in the campaign.  Later, both generals and orderlies had learned to restrain somewhat
their curiosity and their too thoughtless bravery.  The perfect old soldier has learned to
economize the life and strength of men, including his own, with somewhat the same care that
he does those of artillery horses and transportation mules.  It is only the young soldier who
does not know the difference between husbanding the national resources and showing cowardice
in face of the enemy.

At Wilson's Creek, where the brave Lyon was killed in August, 1861, and where the gallant volunteers
on both sides had fought with almost unexampled courage, standing up to their work all the
time, until one third of their numbers were killed or wounded, and their forty rounds of ammunition
gone, the little companies of old, regular Indian-fighters had been deployed as skirmishers
in close order, behind trees and bushes and hillocks, and had suffered comparatively small
losses.  The following colloquy occurred between one of them and a volunteer whose cartridge-box,
as he was proud to show, was empty.  Volunteer:  ""How many shots did you fire?"" Old soldier
(looking into his cartridge-box):  ""I fired just nineteen.""  Volunteer:  ""And how many rebs
do you think you killed?"" Old soldier:  ""I guess I killed about nineteen.""

One beautiful, quiet Sunday afternoon, in front of Atlanta, when even the pickets were respecting
the Sabbath day, my headquarters band, which had been playing selections of sacred music, easily
heard on the other side of the lines, struck up a favorite Southern air of quite a different
character.  Quickly came a shell crashing through the trees far over our heads.  The band as
quickly took the hint and changed the tune.  Such little ""courtesies"" from our ""friends the
enemy"" were not at all uncommon in the short intervals of rest from deadly work.

                                                     THE ASSAULT ON KENESAW

General Sherman says in Vol. II, page 60, of his ""Memoirs"":

""During the 24th and 25th of June, General Schofield extended his right as far as prudent,
so as to compel the enemy to thin out his lines correspondingly, with the intention to make
two strong assaults at points where success would give us the greatest advantage.  I had consulted
Generals Thomas, McPherson, and Schofield, and we all agreed that we could not with prudence
stretch out any more, and therefore there was no alternative but to attack 'fortified lines'--a
thing carefully avoided up to that time.""

The first sentence literally means that I extended my right ""with the intention,"" on my part,
""to make two strong assaults,"" etc. But that is a mere verbal error.  General Sherman, of course,
meant to say that the intention was his.

The second sentence is, perhaps, ambiguous.  At least it has been construed to mean more than
the truth.  It is undoubtedly true that ""we all agreed that we could not with prudence stretch
out any more,"" but we did not agree in the conclusion ""and therefore there was no alternative,""
etc.

Indeed, such conclusion was extremely illogical, as was demonstrated a few days later, when
one of the other ""alternatives"" was adopted with success.  This successful movement was essentially
the same as that which had been previously made to dislodge the enemy from Dalton, and that
by which Sherman's army had been transferred from New Hope Church to the railroad in front
of Allatoona, as well as that by which Atlanta was afterward captured.  Hence the existence
of this ""alternative"" could not have been unthought of by any of us at the time of the assault
on Kenesaw.

But there was another alternative in this and similar cases, which was much discussed at various
times during the campaign.  Its practicability can be judged of only upon general principles,
for it was never tried.  It was to detach two or three corps, nearly half our army (which was
about double the strength of the enemy), make a detour wide enough to avoid his fortifications,
and strike directly at his flank and rear.  Such a movement, it was urged, at Dalton, Kenesaw,
or Atlanta would have compelled Johnston to fight a battle on equal terms with one half of
Sherman's army, while he had to hold his parapets against the other half.  Whatever else may
be said of this proposed movement, it would undoubtedly have been more hazardous and much more
decisive, one way or the other, than any of the plans actually adopted.  It certainly promised
success proportionate to the cost, instead of a costly failure, which the assault of fortified
lines had almost invariably proved to be.

I did not see Thomas or McPherson for some days before the assault, but I believe their judgment,
like mine, was opposed to it. Undoubtedly it was generally opposed, though deferentially as
became subordinates toward the commanding general.  The responsibility was entirely Sherman's,
as he afterward frankly stated; and I presume he did not mean to imply otherwise by the language
used in his ""Memoirs"" above quoted (Vol. II, page 60).  General Sherman's orders, issued on
June 24 (Special Field Orders, No. 28), directed each of the three armies to make an attack
(under the word ""assault"" for Thomas and ""attack"" for McPherson and me).  I had made all preparations
to carry out the order on my part.  Being visited by General Sherman a day or two before the
date named for the execution of the order (June 27), I explained to him what I had done, and
how little hope there was of success, on account of the smallness of my reserve to push the
advantage even if we should break the line, when he at once replied that it was not intended
that I should make an attack in front, but to make a strong demonstration in my front, and
gain what advantage I could on the enemy's flank.  During the day Cox's division forced the
passage of Olley's Creek and secured a position on the head of Nickajack, which was spoken
of by Sherman as the only success of the day.

                                                 TENDENCY OF VETERAN TROOPS

There were doubtless many occasions in the Atlanta campaign when the enemy's intrenchments
could have been assaulted with success. These were when the position had been but recently
occupied and the fortifications were very slight.  After several days' occupation, as at the
points attacked by Thomas and McPherson, the lines became impregnable.  Frequent efforts were
made, and by none more earnestly than by General Sherman, to press the troops to a vigorous
assault of the enemy's position under the favorable circumstances above referred to.  But the
general feeling of the army, including not only privates, but officers of nearly all grades,
was undoubtedly opposed to such attacks.  The notion was very prevalent that there was no necessity
of fighting the enemy on unequal terms.  When attacked, either with or without cover, the troops
would fight with the most determined valor, and almost invariably with success.  So when attacking
the enemy in open ground there was no lack of energy or pluck.  But we lose one of the most
important lessons of the war if we fail to remember and appreciate the fact that our veteran
troops are very loath to make an attack where they believe they have not a fair chance of success.
This feeling must be attributed, not to a lack of high soldierly qualities, but to intelligence
and good sense.  The veteran American soldier fights very much as he has been accustomed to
work his farm or run his sawmill:  He wants to see a fair prospect that it is ""going to pay.""
His loyalty, discipline, and pluck will not allow him under any circumstances to retreat without
orders, much less to run away; but if he encounters a resistance which he thinks he cannot
overcome, or which he thinks it would ""cost too much"" to overcome, he will lie down, cover
himself with a little parapet, and hold his ground against any force that may attempt to drive
him back.  This feeling of the soldier is an element in the problem of war which cannot be
ignored. The general who, with such an army, would win the full measure of success due to greatly
superior numbers, must manoeuver so as to compel the enemy to fight him on approximately equal
terms, instead of assaulting fortifications where, against modern weapons, numbers are of little
or no avail.  In the days of the bayonet successful tactics consisted in massing a superior
force upon some vital point, and breaking the enemy's line.  Now it is the fire of the musket,
not the bayonet, that decides the battle.  To mass troops against the fire of a covered line
is simply to devote them to destruction. The greater the mass, the greater the loss--that is
all.  A large mass has no more chance of success than a small one.  That this is absolutely
true since the introduction of breech-loaders is probably not doubted by any one; and it was
very nearly true with the muzzle- loading rifles used during our late war, as was abundantly
demonstrated on many occasions.

I have always believed that the true tactics of our late war, whenever our force was double
that of the enemy (as it sometimes was and always should have been at all points where decisive
movements were to be made), were to throw one half the force upon the enemy's rear, so as to
compel him to attack that force or else retreat by side roads with loss of trains and artillery.
This would doubtless have been a bold departure from the ancient tactics, which had not yet
been proved obsolete.  Yet I always thought it strange that our leading generals were unwilling
to attempt it. Had Sherman divided his army in such a way, and struck at Hood's rear, he might
have found a chance to destroy that army as well as the railroads in Georgia.

                                      THE DEATH OF McPHERSON BEFORE ATLANTA

The death of McPherson, on July 22, was felt by all to be an irreparable loss, and by none
more so than by General Sherman, who manifested deep feeling when the body was brought to the
Howard House, east of Atlanta.  I recollect well his remark to the effect that the whole of
the Confederacy could not atone for the sacrifice of one such life.

My recollection of some of the incidents of that day differs in some respects from that of
General Sherman.  As soon as it was known that the Army of the Tennessee was heavily engaged
I drew out of line the larger part of my troops, leaving the picket-line in position, with
strong reserves behind the parapets, and massed them near my left, ready to send reinforcements
to the Army of the Tennessee if necessary, or to form a temporary left flank if the line on
my left should be broken, as it was late in the day, as described by General Sherman.( 4)

When that break was made in the line immediately to the left of mine, I had a rare opportunity
of witnessing Sherman's splendid conduct as a simple soldier, the occasion for which occurs
so rarely to the general-in-chief of a great army.  Sherman at once sent to me for all my artillery,
which responded to his call at a full gallop.  He led the batteries in person to some high,
open ground in front of our line near the Howard House, placed them in position, and directed
their fire, which from that advanced position enfiladed the parapets from which our troops
had been driven, and which the enemy then occupied.  With the aid of that terrible raking fire,
the division of Union troops very quickly regained the intrenchments they had lost.  General
Sherman, on page 81, Vol. II, gives me the credit due to himself for that soldierly conduct
as an artillery commander.  I was occupied in forming my infantry reserve to meet the enemy
if Logan's troops did not drive them back.  Only my artillery was used in restoring this broken
line, because Logan's infantry proved sufficient without further aid. This action of mine was
taken with General Sherman's knowledge and approval, and was the correct thing to do, for the
reason that the ground in my front was such as to make both my position and that of the enemy
practically unassailable.  I had no apprehension of an attack in my front, and there was no
question of my attempting to ""make a lodgment in Atlanta"" that day, as stated by Sherman in
Vol. II, page 80.

It was proposed by me that my reserve and Thomas's should go the assistance of the Army of
the Tennessee, either directly or, better still, by making a counter-attack in front of the
right of that army, which, if successful, would cut off the hostile force then attacking in
left.  Sherman replied, as I recollect, that he had asked Thomas to send some troops to the
left, and the latter had replied that he had none to spare.  Without these the proposition
to make a counter-attack could not be entertained.  But my memory is only that of conversations
with General Sherman during the day, and he ought to be much better informed than I concerning
what passed between General Thomas and himself.  I recollect that General Sherman during the
day expressed something like a wish to ""let the Army of the Tennessee fight its own battle,""
but in his statement of motive for so doing I think he does that army injustice.  My impression
was, and is, that they would have been very glad of assistance, and that timely help would
have increased the fraternal feeling between the armies, instead of creating unworthy jealousy.

I cannot but believe, as I then thought, that we were losing a great opportunity that day.
A large force of the enemy had made a wide circuit from his defenses about Atlanta and attacked
our left several miles distant.  We there had a chance to fight him on equal terms.  I thought,
and still think, we ought to have concentrated a large part of Thomas's force and mine near
the Howard House, and made a strong counter-attack upon this attacking column of the enemy,
with the hope of cutting it off from Atlanta.  Instead of this, Thomas spent the day in efforts
to ""make a lodgment in Atlanta"" over well-prepared fortifications which the Georgia militia
could hold against him about as well as the veteran Confederate troops.

The movement of August 4 and 5 was designed to be substantially what had been frequently suggested,
but which I have heretofore referred to as having never been tried, with the exception that
the attacking force was not to sever its connection with the main body, and hence might not
reach far enough to strike an exposed flank of the enemy.  But even with this modification
I thought the movement ought to have a fair chance of success.  That movement was not suggested
by me in any way, and, so far as I know, not by General Thomas.  I believe it originated entirely
with General Sherman.  I never heard of it until I received his orders.  There was no ""argument""
by me of the question of relative rank, as suggested by General Sherman (Vol. II, page 99).

                             SHERMAN'S ERROR IN A QUESTION OF RELATIVE RANK

The positions of the troops when the order for the movement was made rendered it convenient
that the Twenty-third Corps be put in first,--that is, next to the right of General Thomas's
troops then in position,--while the Fourteenth Corps, commanded by General John M. Palmer,
was relied upon to develop rapidly to our right and endeavor to strike the enemy's flank before
he could extend his intrenched line far enough to meet and resist our attack.  It was not until
some time after my orders for this movement had been issued and should have been in progress
of vigorous execution that I received the first intimation that the question of rank had been
raised, as stated by General Sherman, and that my orders had simply been transmitted to the
division commanders of the Fourteenth Corps.

It cannot for a moment be admitted that any share of the blame for that failure attaches to
the Fourteenth Corps, as such.  Nor do I believe with General Sherman that its slowness on
that occasion was due to anything ""imbibed"" from General Thomas.

                             SHERMAN'S ERROR IN A QUESTION OF RELATIVE RANK

My own view of military duty was different from that entertained by the commander of the Fourteenth
Corps, as was shown in my subsequent action, hereinafter referred to, when I was ordered to
report to and act under the orders of General Stanley.  But if the distinguished statesman
who then commanded the Fourteenth Corps fell into error at that time, he has doubtless since
regretted it far more than any other man could possible do; and he has many times atoned for
that error by the great services to the country which he has continued to render up to the
present time.

The primary and principal cause of this and all similar difficulties during the Atlanta campaign
was the grave error of opinion which disregarded the special rank of army and department commanders
given them by the President's assignment under the law, and the still graver error of judgment
in leaving such an important question open until the eve of battle, in the ""hope that there
would be no necessity for making this decision.""  This error seems incomprehensible when it
is considered that it in effect nullified the President's selection of army and department
commanders at the most important of all moments, the crisis of battle, by making these commanders
subject to the orders of any general of older commission whose troops happened to be adjacent
to theirs.

In the midst of battle, when the orders of a common superior cannot be obtained in time to
meet an emergency, the highest commander present must give the necessary orders and must be
obeyed.  This is probably the gravest responsibility of war.  Yet Sherman's opinion and decision
would have placed this responsibility, not upon the army commander who had been selected by
the President, upon the advice of the general-in-chief, under an act of Congress passed especially
for the purpose, but upon some one who through political influence or otherwise had got an
earlier commission of major-general.  So many of the latter had proved to be unqualified for
responsible command that Congress had enacted a special law authorizing the President to supersede
such prior commissions and assign commanders of armies or army corps in the field and in any
department whom he deemed competent.( 5)  Palpable as this fallacy seems, yet it was adhered
to until overruled by the War Department.

It is proper for me to add that I had at that time but a very slight personal acquaintance
with General Palmer.  However, I knew him well by reputation, and esteemed him highly.  General
Thomas, especially, had given me a high estimate of his character and abilities.  If there
was any cause of jealousy or ill-feeling between us, I never suspected it.

with the money for which he was responsible, to another staff officer, saying that he was going

[( 4) Vol.

When all our efforts to accomplish decisive results by partial operations upon the flanks had
failed, this question was much discussed:  What more decisive movement shall next be made for
the capture of Atlanta?  There were practically but two propositions to be considered:  That
of General Sherman, which was adopted with success; and that heretofore referred to as having
never been tried, to detach two or more corps to make a lodgment on the railroad at or below
East Point, and then compel the enemy to come out of Atlanta and endeavor to regain control
of his only line of supply, or abandon that city altogether.  General Sherman thought it too
hazardous to detach two corps, though he was willing for me to undertake it with one.  In fact,
this feeling marked General Sherman's action throughout the campaign.  He had no hesitation
in detaching a small force, the loss of which would still leave him greatly superior in numbers
to the enemy, or a very large force under his own command, leaving the enemy to the care of
the smaller part, as in his march to Savannah.  General Thomas, on the contrary, thought the
movement proposed by General Sherman ""extra hazardous,"" as Sherman says in his ""Memoirs"" (Vol.
II, page 106).  I did not regard either of them as very hazardous, and upon consideration rather
preferred General Sherman's, because I thought it could not fail to be decisive of the capture
of Atlanta, while the other might fail if not executed with promptness and vigor, and this,
experience had warned us, we could not be quite sure of.

                                      JOHNSTON'S UNTRIED PLAN OF RESISTANCE

Some time after the war, that very able commander General Joseph E. Johnston told me that in
his judgment Sherman's operations in Hood's rear ought not to have caused the evacuation of
Atlanta; that he (Johnston), when in command, had anticipated such a movement, and had prepared,
or intended to prepare, to oppose it by constructing artillery redoubts at all suitable points
in the rear of Atlanta, as well as in front, which redoubts could be very speedily connected
by infantry intrenchments whenever necessary; that he aimed to keep on longer than Sherman's
army could subsist on the contents of their wagons and haversacks; and that Sherman could not
possibly hold all the railroads leading into Atlanta at the same time, nor destroy any one
of them so thoroughly that it could not be repaired in time to replenish Johnston's supplies
in Atlanta.

Here is presented a question well worthy of the candid study of military critics.  Whatever
may be the final judgment upon that question, it seems perfectly clear that Johnston's plan
of defense ought at least to have been tried by his successor.  If Hood had kept all his troops
in compact order about Atlanta, he would have been in the best possible condition to resist
Sherman if the latter turned back from Jonesboro' and attacked Atlanta from the rear, or to
strike Sherman's rear or flank in full force if he made any other movement.  The division of
Hood's forces at that time, one part holding on to Atlanta while the other went to head off
Sherman, was the worst disposition that could have been made.

As related to me personally by General Sheridan,--for I have not yet studied the Virginia campaigns
so thoroughly as to justify me in speaking from the records,--it was a similar mistake on the
part of the Confederate cavalry commander J. E. B. Stuart, in trying to get between Sheridan
and Richmond, which gave Sheridan the advantage and led to Stuart's defeat.  Stuart had ridden
hard all night, and got between Sheridan and Richmond, his men and horses exhausted, while
Sheridan had been resting and feeding his own men and animals. In the morning Sheridan ""rode
over"" his exhausted antagonist. These are among the many cases where exaggerated ideas of the
importance of places have led to the defeat of armies.  I knew Stuart well at West Point, he
having been in the class next to mine.  He then gave promise of his future as a cavalry leader.

The only specially hazardous part of Sherman's movement was that which would fall to my lot--namely,
to hold the ""pivot"" against a possible attack of Hood's whole army while Thomas and Howard
should swing round it, and then draw out and join them after the swing was made.  Upon my reporting
that I was perfectly willing to undertake this task, and had no doubt of the ability of my
corps to accomplish it, all question about making the movement appeared to be settled, and
it was at once ordered.  Hood did not avail himself of his opportunity to attack me when alone,
either in position or in motion, hence my part of the movement proved easiest of all.

I had placed my corps in a completely inclosed field-work, large enough to contain all my trains,
and strong enough to resist any attack from a greatly superior force until Sherman's movement
could be accomplished.

                                          ANECDOTES OF THE MEN IN THE RANKS

I recollect even to this day a little incident of that time which was, at least to me, both
amusing and instructive.  After receiving Sherman's orders, which meant ""suspend aggressive
work and go to fortifying,"" I was directing the laying out of the new work at the most important
part of the line, and the men had been ordered to commence digging, when I heard an old volunteer,
as he laid aside his gun and put off his accoutrements with manifest reluctance, say, sotto
voce:  ""Well, if digging is the way to put down the rebellion, I guess we will have to do it.""
Our old soldiers had a ""mind of their own,"" and were not afraid to let their commanders know
it; yet they were essentially as thoroughly subordinate and reliable as any troops any general
ever had the honor to command.

I now recall another incident which occurred a few days earlier, in which a young Indiana volunteer
was somewhat less respectful, though he had no idea whom he was addressing, nor, probably,
any thought whatever about ""relative rank.""  I had come out from my tent, before sunrise in
the morning, and was performing my morning ablutions in the ordinary camp basin, preparatory
to putting on my outer clothing.  None of my ""people"" were yet up, and the night sentinel of
my camp was a little way off.  There came up a weary, belated soldier who had, perhaps, been
trudging along much of the night, trying to overtake his regiment.  I heard him ask in a loud
voice:  ""Where is the 128th Indiana?""  Not supposing the question was addressed to me, I did
not look up.  Then came in still louder tones and in an amended form which left no room for
doubt as to whom it was addressed:  ""I mean you old fellow there with the red shirt!  Where
is the 128th Indiana?""

If from lapse of time my memory may not be exact as to the number of the regiment, I am sure
no apology is necessary to the gallant 128th.  It was, anyhow, one of those very high-numbered
new Indiana regiments which had recently joined the army.  The young soldier was sent to the
headquarters escort, given his breakfast, and carried along until his regiment was overtaken.

The Twenty-third Corps reached the railroad about the close of day on August 31, having time
to do no more than intrench our positions. The orders that day and night were urgent to make
the destruction of the railroad thorough and extensive.  This was evidently General Sherman's
primary object, showing a doubt in his mind whether the effect of his movement would be the
speedy abandonment of Atlanta, or whether he would have to trust to his destruction of the
railroad to accomplish that object.

Late in the night of the 31st, after General Stanley and I, who were encamped near together,
had gone to sleep, we received despatches from General Sherman stating in effect that as we
were too far from the main body of the army to receive orders from him or General Thomas, our
two corps must act on the morrow under the orders of the highest commander present, and that
General Stanley, having the older commission, was that highest commander.  I was therefore
directed to report to General Stanley and act under his orders. I replied to General Sherman
that while I differed from him in opinion upon the question of relative rank, I would for the
present cheerfully abide his decision and execute his orders.  Early the next morning, before
I had time to report to General Stanley, he appeared at my camp, evidently much disturbed by
the orders he had received.  He said General Sherman was wrong; that he was not entitled to
the command and did not want it; and urged me to accept the chief command, and let him act
under my orders.  I replied that General Sherman's order was imperative, and I could not relieve
him (General Stanley) from the responsibility of executing it.  It was all wrong, but there
was no present remedy, and he must do the best he could.  The position of his corps on the
right made it necessary that it should have the advance in the day's movement, while I would
follow close after and support him under all circumstances.

                                                  THE FAILURE AT JONESBORO'

So we started early in the morning to execute Sherman's orders-- thoroughly to destroy the
railroad, and close down on Thomas toward Jonesboro'.  That morning, as Sherman says (Vol.
II, page 107), ""Howard found an intrenched foe (Hardee's corps) covering Jonesboro',"" and ""orders
were sent to Generals Thomas and Schofield to turn straight for Jonesboro', tearing up the
railroad track as they advanced.""  But of course, as General Sherman had anticipated, such
orders could not reach me in time to do any good.  They were not received until after the affair
at Jonesboro' was ended.  But hearing the sound of battle in our front, I rode rapidly forward
to the head of Stanley's column, which was then not advancing, made inquiries for that officer,
and was informed that he was trying to find General Thomas to get orders.  I immediately brought
my infantry of the Twenty-third Corps out of the road occupied by Stanley's corps, moved it
to the front through woods and fields, and endeavored to find a way by which I could reach
the enemy's flank or rear, riding so far ahead with a few staff officers and orderlies that
I escaped very narrowly being captured by the enemy.  Finally, near dark, General Stanley's
troops began to deploy and attack the enemy; and as there were more troops on the ground than
could possibly be used that day, I could do not more than stand and watch their movements,
as I did with intense interest until my medical director, Dr. Hewit, one of the bravest and
coolest men I ever knew, called my attention to the fact that the place was much too hot for
a general and his staff who had nothing to do there.  I believe if General Sherman had been
in our place he would have thought it ""more than a skirmish-line"" (Vol. II, page 108) in Stanley's
front that gave us that fire both of musketry and artillery which my staff officers have frequently
spoken of as one of the ugliest they ever experienced.  General Stanley's fault was, not that
he deployed his troops, but that he did not put them in at once when he arrived on the ground,
instead of waiting for orders.  But General Stanley, whose gallantry was never questioned,
was a subordinate in experience. He had but recently risen to the command of a corps, and had
been little accustomed to act on his own responsibility.  Feeling overburdened with the responsibility
wrongfully thrust upon him that day, he naturally sought relief from it by reporting for orders
to General Thomas as soon as his corps was reunited to the main army.

The failure at Jonesboro', as at so many other places, was due to that erroneous interpretation
of the law that threw the supreme responsibility at the crisis of battle upon untried and (in
this case) unwilling shoulders, or else left the lawful commander without recognized authority,
to beg in vain of others to ""co-operate"" with him.

                                                     THE CAPTURE OF ATLANTA

During the night of August 31 others besides General Sherman were too restless and impatient
to sleep (Vol. II, page 108).  The sounds of explosion in Atlanta were distinctly heard, and
the flashes of light distinctly seen.  With the compass for direction and the watch for intervals
of time between flash and sound, there was no difficulty in locating their origin at Atlanta.
An untutored farmer may well have thought ""these sounds were just like those of a battle,""
but a practised ear could not have failed to note the difference.  First there would come an
explosion louder and unlike the report of one or several guns, and this would be followed by
numerous smaller, sharper, and perfectly distinct reports, quite unlike that of musketry, which
could not be mistaken for anything but the explosion of shells.  There could be no room for
doubt that these lights and sounds meant the destruction in Atlanta of magazines or carloads
of fixed ammunition, and hence that Hood was abandoning that place.  I reported my observations
and conclusion to General Sherman, but he ""still remained in doubt.""  The doubt was to me incomprehensible;
but perhaps that was because I had no doubt from the start, whether I was right or wrong, what
the result would be. My period of elation was when we got firm hold of the railroad at Rough
and Ready.  Hood having failed to attack our exposed flank during the movement, the fall of
Atlanta was already an accomplished fact with me when Sherman was still in doubt, as well as
when Thomas thought the news ""too good to be true.""  But the above is worthy of noting only
as a necessary introduction to something far more important.

Hood's army was now divided and scattered over a distance of thirty miles, one corps below
Jonesboro' being just driven from its ground with considerable loss and in retreat to Lovejoy's,
the main body leaving Atlanta and stretched along the road toward McDonough; while Sherman's
whole army, except Slocum's corps, was in compact order about Jonesboro', nearly in a straight
line between Atlanta and Lovejoy's.  This seemed exactly the opportunity to destroy Hood's
army, if that was the objective of the campaign.  So anxious was I that this be attempted that
I offered to go with two corps, or even with one, and intercept Hood's retreat on the McDonough
road, and hold him until Sherman could dispose of Hardee or interpose his army between him
and Hood.  But more prudent counsels prevailed, and we remained quietly in our camps for five
days, while Hood leisurely marched round us with all his baggage and Georgia militia, and collected
his scattered fragments at Lovejoy's.

Atlanta had become, like Richmond, in popular estimation the real objective of military operations.
The public lost sight of the fact that it was armies in the field, and not fortified places,
which gave strength to the rebellion; and apparently even prominent generals, if they did not
share the popular delusion, at least recognized its value.  The capture of Atlanta was enough
to meet the ""political necessity,"" make ""the election of Mr. Lincoln certain,"" and win rejoicings
and congratulations from all parts of the North!  It was not worth while to run any risk of
trying to do more at that time!  It had to be left for two of Sherman's corps, after the other
four had gone on ""the march to the sea,"" to fight Hood at Columbia and Spring Hill, hurl him
back from Franklin, and then, with reinforcements not equal to half what Sherman had taken
away, to overwhelm him at Nashville.  Why was not this done with a much larger force under
Sherman at Atlanta?  This is one of the questions for the future historian to discuss.

During our rest near Lovejoy's, General Sherman requested me to give him a statement in writing
of my dissent from his decision upon the question of relative rank, which I did.  This he submitted
to the War Department for decision, as a ""question of rank that had arisen between Generals
Schofield and Stanley.""  At this General Stanley was very indignant, as well as at General
Sherman's censure of his conduct on September 1; for the reason that no question of rank had
been raised by us, and the command was thrust upon him in opposition to his wish and in violation
of the law as he understood it.  In due time came the decision of the War Department, written
by General Halleck, sustaining the view of the law Stanley and I had taken, and reversing that
of General Sherman; also kindly commending my action in waiving the question during active
operations.

It was by virtue of the above decision of the War Department that I, instead of General Stanley,
had command of the force that in the following November, 1864, opposed Hood's advance from
the Tennessee River and repulsed his fierce assault at Franklin.

                                                       ABSENT FROM THE ARMY

As I was absent from the army on business connected with my department during most of Hood's
raid upon the railroad in the rear of Atlanta (Sherman having announced his purpose to let
his army rest during that time), I have little to say in respect to the operations resulting
therefrom.  But some things in Sherman's account seem to require a little elucidation.

Being informed by General Sherman of Hood's movement, I hurried to the front and tried to reach
the army by a special train with a small guard from Cleveland, Tenn., but met, October 13,
the head of Hood's column at Dalton, where several trains of cars with supplies and men without
arms returning from furlough on their way to Sherman had been stopped by the reported approach
of Hood.  I ordered all back to Cleveland, and we barely had time to escape capture by Hood's
cavalry.  On arriving at Cleveland, I reported by telegraph to General Thomas, then at Nashville;
and he desired me to go to Chattanooga, take command of the troops there, and prepare to defend
that place, which it was thought Hood might attempt to take by a coup de main, or to co-operate
with Sherman. As General Sherman says (Vol. II, page 156), ""Hood had broken up the telegraph,
and thus had prevented quick communication""; but through my own scouts and spies I was able
to keep track of Hood's movements.  As soon as he turned westward I determined to move with
the troops, when no longer necessary to the defense of Chattanooga, rapidly to Trenton and
Valley Head, seize the passes through the Lookout range, and prevent Hood's escape in that
direction, presuming that Sherman would intercept his retreat down the Chattanooga valley.
I sent a courier to General Sherman informing him of my purpose, and informed General Thomas
by telegraph.  But the latter disapproved my plan, and directed me to move to defend Caperton's
Ferry.  This is what General Sherman refers to in his despatch of October 16:  ""Your first
move on Trenton and Valley Head was right; the move to defend Caperton's Ferry is wrong.  Notify
General Thomas of these, my views.""  But the difference between right and wrong proved immaterial,
since Hood was left free to escape down the Chattanooga valley.  Why this was done, or why
Sherman did not want to force the enemy east, by Spring Place, into the barren mountains, where
Johnston would have been compelled to go if McPherson's move on Resaca in May had been successful,
seems a mystery.  The explanation is probably to be found in Sherman's wish that Hood would
go where he would not be compelled to follow, and thus would leave him (Sherman) a clear road
for his march to the sea.  Indeed the conviction seems irresistible that Sherman and Hood could
hardly have acted in more perfect concert if they had been under the same commander.  The one
did exactly what the other wanted, and the other took care not to interfere with his movement.

At the close of the Atlanta campaign, I promised General Sherman that I would, as soon as I
should be able to do so, write a full critical history of that campaign as a text-book for
military students.  I have not yet found time to fulfil that promise.  The foregoing pages
were intended, when written, as only a very partial fulfilment of that task, and that almost
entirely of one side of it--far the most difficult side.  The other side is so easy, comparatively,
and is already so familiar to military students, that further elucidation now seems hardly
necessary.  Yet I hope, as a labor of love, if for no other reason, to present my impressions
of those grand tactical evolutions of a compact army of one hundred thousand men, as I witnessed
them with the intense interest of a young commander and student of the great art which has
so often in the history of the world determined the destinies of nations.

                                        HOOD'S OPERATIONS IN SHERMAN'S REAR

After the capture of Atlanta, in September, 1864, General Sherman proposed to give his army
rest for a month while he perfected his plans and preparations for a change of base to some
point on the Atlantic or the gulf, in pursuance of the general plan outlined by General Grant
before the Atlanta campaign was opened in May.  But the Confederate commander took the initiative,
about September 20, by moving his army around Sherman's right, striking his railroad about
Allatoona and toward Chattanooga, doing some damage, and then marching off westward with the
design of transferring the theater of war from Georgia to Alabama, Mississippi, or Tennessee.

Sherman very promptly decided not to accept that challenge to meet Hood upon a field chosen
by the latter, but to continue substantially the original plan for his own operations, having
in view also new ulterior plans opened to him by this erratic movement of his adversary.  An
essential modification of the original plan, to meet the unexpected movement of Hood, was to
send back into Tennessee force enough, in addition to the troops then there and others to be
assembled from the rear, to cope with Hood in the event of his attempting the invasion of Tennessee
and Kentucky, or to pursue and occupy his attention if he should attempt to follow Sherman.
General George H. Thomas, commanding the Department of the Cumberland, whose headquarters were
at Nashville, was already at that place, and was directed by General Sherman to assume command
of all the troops in the three departments under Sherman's command, except those with the latter
in Georgia, and to direct the operations against Hood.

Thomas had in his department at that time only the garrisons and railroad guards which had
been deemed essential during the preceding operations in Georgia; and many of those were soon
to be discharged by expiration of their terms of enlistment, their places to be supplied by
new regiments coming from the rear.  General A. J. Smith's corps, then in Missouri, about ten
thousand strong, was ordered to Tennessee, and Sherman also ordered Stanley, with the Fourth
Corps, about twelve thousand men, to return from Georgia to Tennessee and report to Thomas.
Stanley had started by rail to Tullahoma, and was to march, as he did, from the latter point
to Pulaski, Tennessee, which had been selected as the point of concentration for Thomas's forces.
This was the situation when I returned to the army and reported in person to General Sherman.

Under Sherman's promise of a month's rest for his army, I had gone back to attend to the business
of my department, as General Thomas had also done, and hence was in the rear when Hood made
his raid upon Sherman's railroad.  Upon reporting to General Sherman near the end of October,
I learned for the first time his purpose to march to Savannah, and what troops he had provided
for Thomas in Tennessee.  I told Sherman, with that perfect candor which he always invited,
that in my opinion Thomas's force was much too small; that Hood evidently intended to invade
Tennessee; and that he would not be diverted from his purpose by Sherman's march in the opposite
direction, but would, on the contrary, be encouraged thereby to pursue his own plan.  Hence
I requested Sherman to send me back with the Twenty-third Corps to join Thomas.  Sherman at
first appeared to understand my suggestions as a desire to be left in Tennessee instead of
Thomas, the latter to go with Sherman.  But I explained to him emphatically that such was not
my thought.  I took it for granted that Thomas was to command the army in Tennessee, and I
wanted only to go back and help him because he would, in my opinion, have to do the fighting
while Sherman's march would be unopposed.  Sherman then replied that he must have three grand
divisions, under Slocum, Howard, and myself, to make his army complete, and that he could not
spare me; and he gave no indication of concurrence in my opinion that he ought to send back
more troops.

                                                  SENT BACK TO THOMAS'S AID

After leaving General Sherman that afternoon and returning to my own camp, I wrote him a letter
giving a special reason why my corps, rather than any other, should be sent back to Tennessee
in order that it might be filled up my new regiments which had been ordered from the North.
No answer came to these suggestions until I had made three days' march toward Atlanta, en route
for Savannah. Then I received an order, October 30, to march to the nearest point on the railroad,
and report by telegraph to General Thomas for orders.

At first General Thomas ordered me to move by rail to Tullahoma, and then march across to Pulaski,
as Stanley was doing.  But just then Forrest with his cavalry appeared at Johnsonville, on
the Tennessee River west of Nashville, and destroyed a great quantity of property, General
Thomas not having sufficient force available to oppose him; hence on November 3 Thomas ordered
me to come at once by rail to Nashville with my corps, where I reported to him with the advance
of my troops on November 5.  He then ordered me to go at once with some of my troops to Johnsonville
and dispose of the Confederate cavalry there, and then to return to Nashville and proceed to
Pulaski, to take command of all the troops in the field, which would then include the Fourth
Corps, my own Twenty- third, except the detachment left at Johnsonville, and the cavalry watching
Hood toward Florence.  My duty at Johnsonville, where I left two brigades, was soon disposed
of; and I then returned to Nashville, and went at once by rail to Pulaski, arriving at that
place in the evening of November 13.

Some so-called histories of the Tennessee campaign have been based upon the theory that I was
marching from Georgia to Tennessee, to unite my corps with General Thomas's army at Nashville,
when I encountered Hood at Franklin, and after a sharp contest managed to elude him and continue
my march and unite with the Army of the Cumberland at Nashville.  Hence I wish to point out
clearly that I had been with the entire Twenty-third Corps to Nashville, with a part of it
to Johnsonville and back to Nashville, and thence to Columbia and near Pulaski, all by rail;
that all of the Army of the Cumberland then in Tennessee was the Fourth Corps and the cavalry
at and near Pulaski; that General Thomas placed those troops under my command, and that they
remained so until after the battle of Franklin, November 30, and the retreat to Nashville that
night; and that General Thomas did not have an army at Nashville until December 1.  I had united
with Thomas's troops two weeks before the battle of Franklin, and was commanding his army in
the field as well as my own during that time.  If the historians had read the records ( 1)
they could not possibly have fallen into such a mistake.

                              FAULTY INSTRUCTIONS TO OPPOSE HOOD AT PULASKI

Before reaching Pulaski I was furnished with an order from General Thomas's headquarters assigning
me to the command in the field, by virtue of my rank as a department commander, and a copy
of instructions which had already been telegraphed to General Stanley at Pulaski. I assumed
command in the morning of November 14.  The moment I met Stanley at Pulaski, in the evening
of November 13, he called my attention to the faulty position of the troops and to an error
in General Thomas's instructions, about which I then knew nothing because I was unacquainted
with the geography of the surrounding country.  Upon Stanley's statement, I halted Cox's division
of the Twenty-third Corps a few miles north of Pulaski so that the troops might be the more
readily placed as the situation required when I had time to consider it.  No part of the Twenty-third
Corps actually went to Pulaski, although that was the place to which General Thomas had ordered it.
